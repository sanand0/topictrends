0704.0158,2011-11-09,Complexities of Human Promoter Sequences,"  By means of the diffusion entropy approach, we detect the scale-invariance
characteristics embedded in the 4737 human promoter sequences. The exponent for
the scale-invariance is in a wide range of $[ {0.3,0.9} ]$, which centered at
$\delta_c = 0.66$. The distribution of the exponent can be separated into left
and right branches with respect to the maximum. The left and right branches are
asymmetric and can be fitted exactly with Gaussian form with different widths,
respectively.

0704.0357,2009-11-13,Evolutionary games on minimally structured populations,"  Population structure induced by both spatial embedding and more general
networks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have
a fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These
effects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying
topology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is
described by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this
model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on
the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of
a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes
through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population
structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the
effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local
dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a
continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations
with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio
becomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial
structure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and
counterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains
cooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's
dilemma and also of the ""rock-paper-scissor"" game we find indications of rich
structure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models
with explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and
the emergence of global oscillations.

0704.3808,2009-11-13,On Gene Duplication Models for Evolving Regulatory Networks,"  Background: Duplication of genes is important for evolution of molecular
networks. Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a driving
force in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has been
noted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferential
attachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions of
molecular networks.
  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring by
including directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result of
unidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes to
quantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this in
itself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sites
in procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degree
distribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in the
non-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.
  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantial
recombination of upstream regions could generate main features of genetic
regulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broad
to be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as a
main additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that gene
duplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degree
distributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstream
regions of genes.

0704.3826,2007-08-02,Non-coding DNA programs express adaptation and its universal law,"  Significant fraction (98.5% in humans) of most animal genomes is non- coding
dark matter. Its largely unknown function (1-5) is related to programming
(rather than to spontaneous mutations) of accurate adaptation to rapidly
changing environment. Programmed adaptation to the same universal law for
non-competing animals from anaerobic yeast to human is revealed in the study of
their extensively quantified mortality (6-21). Adaptation of animals with
removed non-coding DNA fractions may specify their contribution to genomic
programming. Emergence of new adaptation programs and their (non-Mendelian)
heredity may be studied in antibiotic mini-extinctions (22-24). On a large
evolutionary scale rapid universal adaptation was vital for survival, and
evolved, in otherwise lethal for diverse species major mass extinctions
(25-28). Evolutionary and experimental data corroborate these conclusions
(6-21, 29-32). Universal law implies certain biological universality of diverse
species, thus quantifies applicability of animal models to humans). Genomic
adaptation programming calls for unusual approach to its study and implies
unanticipated perspectives, in particular, directed biological changes.

0705.1460,2007-05-23,Evolving inductive generalization via genetic self-assembly,"  We propose that genetic encoding of self-assembling components greatly
enhances the evolution of complex systems and provides an efficient platform
for inductive generalization, i.e. the inductive derivation of a solution to a
problem with a potentially infinite number of instances from a limited set of
test examples. We exemplify this in simulations by evolving scalable circuitry
for several problems. One of them, digital multiplication, has been intensively
studied in recent years, where hitherto the evolutionary design of only
specific small multipliers was achieved. The fact that this and other problems
can be solved in full generality employing self-assembly sheds light on the
evolutionary role of self-assembly in biology and is of relevance for the
design of complex systems in nano- and bionanotechnology.
"
0705.1548,2016-01-05,Dimensionality and dynamics in the behavior of C. elegans,"  A major challenge in analyzing animal behavior is to discover some underlying
simplicity in complex motor actions. Here we show that the space of shapes
adopted by the nematode C. elegans is surprisingly low dimensional, with just
four dimensions accounting for 95% of the shape variance, and we partially
reconstruct ""equations of motion"" for the dynamics in this space. These
dynamics have multiple attractors, and we find that the worm visits these in a
rapid and almost completely deterministic response to weak thermal stimuli.
Stimulus-dependent correlations among the different modes suggest that one can
generate more reliable behaviors by synchronizing stimuli to the state of the
worm in shape space. We confirm this prediction, effectively ""steering"" the
worm in real time.
"
0705.1974,2007-12-06,Risk perception in epidemic modeling,"  We investigate the effects of risk perception in a simple model of epidemic
spreading. We assume that the perception of the risk of being infected depends
on the fraction of neighbors that are ill. The effect of this factor is to
decrease the infectivity, that therefore becomes a dynamical component of the
model. We study the problem in the mean-field approximation and by numerical
simulations for regular, random and scale-free networks.
  We show that for homogeneous and random networks, there is always a value of
perception that stops the epidemics. In the ``worst-case'' scenario of a
scale-free network with diverging input connectivity, a linear perception
cannot stop the epidemics; however we show that a non-linear increase of the
perception risk may lead to the extinction of the disease. This transition is
discontinuous, and is not predicted by the mean-field analysis.
"
0705.3612,2007-05-25,Swimming with a friend at low Reynolds number,"  We investigate the hydrodynamic interactions between microorganisms swimming
at low Reynolds number. By considering simple model swimmers, and combining
analytic and numerical approaches, we investigate the time-averaged flow field
around a swimmer. At short distances the swimmer behaves like a pump. At large
distances the velocity field depends on whether the swimming stroke is
invariant under a combined time-reversal and parity transformation. We then
consider two swimmers and find that the interaction between them consists of
two parts; a dead term, independent of the motion of the second swimmer, which
takes the expected dipolar form and a live term resulting from the simultaneous
swimming action of both swimmers which does not. We argue that, in general, the
latter dominates. The swimmer--swimmer interaction is a complicated function of
their relative displacement, orientation and phase, leading to motion that can
be attractive, repulsive or oscillatory.

0705.3724,2008-05-23,"Resonance and frequency-locking phenomena in spatially extended
  phytoplankton-zooplankton system with additive noise and periodic forces","  In this paper, we present a spatial version of phytoplankton-zooplankton
model that includes some important factors such as external periodic forces,
noise, and diffusion processes. The spatially extended
phytoplankton-zooplankton system is from the original study by Scheffer [M
Scheffer, Fish and nutrients interplay determines algal biomass: a minimal
model, Oikos \textbf{62} (1991) 271-282]. Our results show that the spatially
extended system exhibit a resonant patterns and frequency-locking phenomena.
The system also shows that the noise and the external periodic forces play a
constructive role in the Scheffer's model: first, the noise can enhance the
oscillation of phytoplankton species' density and format a large clusters in
the space when the noise intensity is within certain interval. Second, the
external periodic forces can induce 4:1 and 1:1 frequency-locking and spatially
homogeneous oscillation phenomena to appear. Finally, the resonant patterns are
observed in the system when the spatial noises and external periodic forces are
both turned on. Moreover, we found that the 4:1 frequency-locking transform
into 1:1 frequency-locking when the noise intensity increased. In addition to
elucidating our results outside the domain of Turing instability, we provide
further analysis of Turing linear stability with the help of the numerical
calculation by using the Maple software. Significantly, oscillations are
enhanced in the system when the noise term presents. These results indicate
that the oceanic plankton bloom may partly due to interplay between the
stochastic factors and external forces instead of deterministic factors. These
results also may help us to understand the effects arising from undeniable
subject to random fluctuations in oceanic plankton bloom.

0705.4429,2007-06-07,"A successive sub-grouping method for multiple sequence alignments
  analysis","  A novel approach to protein multiple sequence alignment is discussed:
substantially this method counterparts with substitution matrix based methods
(like Blosum or PAM based methods), and implies a more deterministic approach
to chemical/physical sub-grouping of amino acids . Amino acids (aa) are divided
into sub-groups with successive derivations, that result in a clustering based
on the considered property. The properties can be user defined or chosen
between default schemes, like those used in the analysis described here.
Starting from an initial set of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, they
are successively divided on the basis of their polarity/hydrophobic index, with
increasing resolution up to four level of subdivision. Other schemes of
subdivision are possible: in this thesis work it was employed also a scheme
based on physical/structural properties (solvent exposure, lateral chain
mobility and secondary structure tendency), that have been compared to the
chemical scheme with testing purposes. In the method described in this chapter,
the total score for each position in the alignment accounts for different
degree of similarity between amino acids. The scoring value result form the
contribution of each level of selectivity for every individual property
considered. Simply the method (called M_Al) analyse the n sequence alignment
position per position and assigns a score which have contributes by aa identity
plus a composed valuation of the chemical or of the structural affinity between
the n aligned amino acids. This method has been implemented in a series of
programs written in python language; these programs have been tested in some
biological cases, with benchmark purposes.

0705.4635,2019-08-19,"Relationship between cellular response and behavioral variability in
  bacterial chemotaxis","  Bacterial chemotaxis in Escherichia coli is a canonical system for the study
of signal transduction. A remarkable feature of this system is the coexistence
of precise adaptation in population with large fluctuating cellular behavior in
single cells (Korobkova et al. 2004, Nature, 428, 574). Using a stochastic
model, we found that the large behavioral variability experimentally observed
in non-stimulated cells is a direct consequence of the architecture of this
adaptive system. Reversible covalent modification cycles, in which methylation
and demethylation reactions antagonistically regulate the activity of
receptor-kinase complexes, operate outside the region of first-order kinetics.
As a result, the receptor-kinase that governs cellular behavior exhibits a
sigmoidal activation curve. This curve simultaneously amplifies the inherent
stochastic fluctuations in the system and lengthens the relaxation time in
response to stimulus. Because stochastic fluctuations cause large behavioral
variability and the relaxation time governs the average duration of runs in
response to small stimuli, cells with the greatest fluctuating behavior also
display the largest chemotactic response. Finally, Large-scale simulations of
digital bacteria suggest that the chemotaxis network is tuned to simultaneously
optimize the random spread of cells in absence of nutrients and the cellular
response to gradients of attractant.

0706.0163,2011-07-20,Output Stream of Binding Neuron with Feedback,"  The binding neuron model is inspired by numerical simulation of
Hodgkin-Huxley-type point neuron, as well as by the leaky integrate-and-fire
model. In the binding neuron, the trace of an input is remembered for a fixed
period of time after which it disappears completely. This is in the contrast
with the above two models, where the postsynaptic potentials decay
exponentially and can be forgotten only after triggering. The finiteness of
memory in the binding neuron allows one to construct fast recurrent networks
for computer modeling. Recently, the finiteness is utilized for exact
mathematical description of the output stochastic process if the binding neuron
is driven with the Poissonian input stream. In this paper, the simplest
networking is considered for binding neuron. Namely, it is expected that every
output spike of single neuron is immediately fed into its input. For this
construction, externally fed with Poissonian stream, the output stream is
characterized in terms of interspike interval probability density distribution
if the binding neuron has threshold 2. For higher thresholds, the distribution
is calculated numerically. The distributions are compared with those found for
binding neuron without feedback, and for leaky integrator. Sample distributions
for leaky integrator with feedback are calculated numerically as well. It is
oncluded that even the simplest networking can radically alter spikng
statistics. Information condensation at the level of single neuron is
discussed.

principally affect metal up-take in the plant. The relationships between the
concentration of metal in the growth medium, Cs, the concentration of metal
absorbed by the plant, Cp, and the total biomass achieved, M, all of which are
factors relevant to the efficiency of phytoremediation of the plant, have been
investigated via the macro-physiological response of Brassica juncea seedlings
to Ni(II) stress. The factorial growth experiments treated the Ni(II)

independently variable parameters. Observations included the evidence of light
enhancement of Ni toxicity at the root as well as at the whole plant level, the
shoot mass index as a possible indicator of shoot metal sequestration in B.
juncea, the logarithmic variation of Cp with Cs and the power-law dependence of
M on Cp. The sum total of these observations indicate that for the metal
accumulator B. juncea with regard to its capacity to accumulate Ni, the overall
metabolic nature of the plant is important; neither rapid biomass increase nor
a high metal concentration capability favor the removal of high metal mass from
the medium, but rather the plant with the moderate photosynthetically driven
biomass growth and moderate metal concentrations demonstrated the ability to
remove the maximum mass of metal from the medium. The implications of these
observations in the context of the perceived need in phytoremediation
engineering to maximize Cp and M simultaneously in the same plant, are
discussed.

  male mice imposed to chronic social stress","  Anhedonia is one of the key symptoms of depression in humans. Consumption of
1% sucrose solution supplemented with 0.2% vanillin was studied in two
experimental contexts in male mice living under chronic social stress induced
by daily experience of defeats in agonistic interactions and leading to
development of depression. In the first experiment, vanillin sucrose solution
was made available as an option of water during 10 days to mice living in group
home cages. Then the mice were subjected to social defeat stress and during
stress exposure they were provided with both vanillin sucrose solution and
water using a free two bottles choice paradigm. In the other experiment,
vanillin sucrose solution were first offered to mice after 8 days of exposure
to social defeat stress. Males familiar with vanillin sucrose solution showed
vanillin sucrose preference while experiencing defeat stress: consumption of
vanillin sucrose solution was about 70% of total liquid consumption. However,
the consumption of vanillin sucrose solution per gram of body weight in mice
imposed to social stress during 20 days was significantly lower than in control
males. In the second experiment, males after 8 days of social defeat stress
were found to consume significantly less vanillin sucrose solution as compared
with control males. On average during two weeks of measurements, vanillin
sucrose solution intake was less than 20% of total liquid consumption in males
with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Consumption per gram of body weight
also appeared to be significantly lower than in control group. Influence of the
experimental context on the development of anhedonia, which was measured by the
reduction in sucrose solution intake by chronically stressed male mice, has
been discussed.

0706.2328,2010-08-16,Unique mechanisms from finite two-state trajectories,"  Single molecule data made of on and off events are ubiquitous. Famous
examples include enzyme turnover, probed via fluorescence, and opening and
closing of ion-channel, probed via the flux of ions. The data reflects the
dynamics in the underlying multi-substate on-off kinetic scheme (KS) of the
process, but the determination of the underlying KS is difficult, and sometimes
even impossible, due to the loss of information in the mapping of the
mutli-dimensional KS onto two dimensions. A way to deal with this problem
considers canonical (unique) forms. (Unique canonical form is constructed from
an infinitely long trajectory, but many KSs.) Here we introduce canonical forms
of reduced dimensions that can handle any KS (i.e. also KSs with symmetry and
irreversible transitions). We give the mapping of KSs into reduced dimensions
forms, which is based on topology of KSs, and the tools for extracting the
reduced dimensions form from finite data. The canonical forms of reduced
dimensions constitute a powerful tool in discriminating between KSs.

0706.3211,2019-08-19,Path probability density functions for semi-Markovian random walks,"  In random walks, the path representation of the Green's function is an
infinite sum over the length of path probability density functions (PDFs). Here
we derive and solve, in Laplace space, the recursion relation for the n order
path PDF for any arbitrarily inhomogeneous semi-Markovian random walk in a
one-dimensional (1D) chain of L states. The recursion relation relates the n
order path PDF to L/2 (round towards zero for an odd L) shorter path PDFs, and
has n independent coefficients that obey a universal formula. The z transform
of the recursion relation straightforwardly gives the generating function for
path PDFs, from which we obtain the Green's function of the random walk, and
derive an explicit expression for any path PDF of the random walk. These
expressions give the most detailed description of arbitrarily inhomogeneous
semi-Markovian random walks in 1D.

0707.1672,2009-11-13,Spreading of sexually transmitted diseases in heterosexual populations,"  The spread of sexually transmitted diseases (e.g. Chlamydia, Syphilis,
Gonorrhea, HIV) across populations is a major concern for scientists and health
agencies. In this context, both data collection on sexual contact networks and
the modeling of disease spreading, are intensively contributing to the search
for effective immunization policies. Here, the spreading of sexually
transmitted diseases on bipartite scale-free graphs, representing heterosexual
contact networks, is considered. We analytically derive the expression for the
epidemic threshold and its dependence with the system size in finite
populations. We show that the epidemic outbreak in bipartite populations, with
number of sexual partners distributed as in empirical observations from
national sex surveys, takes place for larger spreading rates than for the case
in which the bipartite nature of the network is not taken into account.
Numerical simulations confirm the validity of the theoretical results. Our
findings indicate that the restriction to crossed infections between the two
classes of individuals (males and females) has to be taken into account in the
design of efficient immunization strategies for sexually transmitted diseases.

0707.3043,2010-12-01,p-Adic Modelling of the Genome and the Genetic Code,"  The present paper is devoted to foundations of p-adic modelling in genomics.
Considering nucleotides, codons, DNA and RNA sequences, amino acids, and
proteins as information systems, we have formulated the corresponding p-adic
formalisms for their investigations. Each of these systems has its
characteristic prime number used for construction of the related information
space. Relevance of this approach is illustrated by some examples. In
particular, it is shown that degeneration of the genetic code is a p-adic
phenomenon. We have also put forward a hypothesis on evolution of the genetic
code assuming that primitive code was based on single nucleotides and
chronologically first four amino acids. This formalism of p-adic genomic
information systems can be implemented in computer programs and applied to
various concrete cases.

experiments exemplifies the need for a thorough theoretical understanding of
charge migration in DNA-based natural and artificial materials. Here we present
a review of tight-binding models for DNA conduction which have the intrinsic
merit of containing more structural information than plain rate-equation models

allows for simulations of transport properties to be more manageable with
respect to density functional theory methods or correlated first principle
algorithms.
"
0707.3642,2009-11-13,Mutual information in random Boolean models of regulatory networks,"  The amount of mutual information contained in time series of two elements
gives a measure of how well their activities are coordinated. In a large,
complex network of interacting elements, such as a genetic regulatory network
within a cell, the average of the mutual information over all pairs <I> is a
global measure of how well the system can coordinate its internal dynamics. We
study this average pairwise mutual information in random Boolean networks
(RBNs) as a function of the distribution of Boolean rules implemented at each
element, assuming that the links in the network are randomly placed. Efficient
numerical methods for calculating <I> show that as the number of network nodes
N approaches infinity, the quantity N<I> exhibits a discontinuity at parameter
values corresponding to critical RBNs. For finite systems it peaks near the
critical value, but slightly in the disordered regime for typical parameter
variations. The source of high values of N<I> is the indirect correlations
between pairs of elements from different long chains with a common starting
point. The contribution from pairs that are directly linked approaches zero for
critical networks and peaks deep in the disordered regime.

0708.0297,2007-08-03,Partition test and sexual motivation in male mice,"  Theoretical analysis of own and literature investigations of sexual
motivation with the use of the partition test [Kudryavtseva, 1987, 1994] in
male mice was carried out. It has been shown that appearance of a receptive
female in the neighboring compartment of common cage separated by perforated
transparent partition produces the enhancement of testosterone level in blood
and stimulates the behavioral activity near partition as a reaction to the
receptive female in naive males. In many studies this behavioral activity is
considered as sexual motivation, arising in this experimental context in male
mice. The lack of correlation between behavioral parameters and gonad reaction
of males on receptive female, uninterconnected changes of these two parameters
as well as the lack of sexual behavior between naive male and female when
partition is removed cast doubt on this data interpretation. It has been
supposed that in naive males behavioral reaction to a receptive female is
induced by positive incentive - odor of the female associated with nursing and
warmth from mother and other females which look after posterity. Short-term
increase of the level of testosterone (possessing rewarding properties) is
innate stimulus-response reaction which stimulates and prolongs behavioral
interest of male to receptive female. It has been supposed that after sexual
experience female odor is associated in experienced males with sexual behavior
directed to the sexual partner and resulted in the formation of sexual
motivation. The data are considered also in the light of the theory of
motivated behavior including ""liking"", ""wanting"" and ""learning"" [Robinson and
Berridge, 1993, 2000].

0709.0625,2008-02-11,"Efficient Implementation of the AI-REML Iteration for Variance Component
  QTL Analysis","  Regions in the genome that affect complex traits, quantitative trait loci
(QTL), can be identified using statistical analysis of genetic and phenotypic
data. When restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) models are used, the mapping
procedure is normally computationally demanding. We develop a new efficient
computational scheme for QTL mapping using variance component analysis and the
AI-REML algorithm. The algorithm uses an exact or approximative low-rank
representation of the identity-by-descent matrix, which combined with the
Woodbury formula for matrix inversion results in that the computations in the
AI-REML iteration body can be performed more efficiently. For cases where an
exact low-rank representation of the IBD matrix is available a-priori, the
improved AI-REML algorithm normally runs almost twice as fast compared to the
standard version. When an exact low-rank representation is not available, a
truncated spectral decomposition is used to determine a low-rank approximation.
We show that also in this case, the computational efficiency of the AI-REML
scheme can often be significantly improved.

Complexity Science from a statistical mechanics approach. Ecology is concerned
with understanding how systems level properties emerge out of the multitude of
interactions amongst large numbers of components, leading to ecosystems that
possess the prototypical characteristics of complex systems. We argue that
statistical mechanics is at present the best methodology available to obtain a
quantitative description of complex systems, and that ecology is in urgent need
of ``integrative'' approaches that are quantitative and non-stationary. We
describe examples where combining statistical mechanics and ecology has led to
improved ecological modelling and, at the same time, broadened the scope of
statistical mechanics.

0710.4235,2011-11-10,"Top-Down Causation by Information Control: From a Philosophical Problem
  to a Scientific Research Program","  It has been claimed that different types of causes must be considered in
biological systems, including top-down as well as same-level and bottom-up
causation, thus enabling the top levels to be causally efficacious in their own
right. To clarify this issue, important distinctions between information and
signs are introduced here and the concepts of information control and
functional equivalence classes in those systems are rigorously defined and used
to characterise when top down causation by feedback control happens, in a way
that is testable. The causally significant elements we consider are equivalence
classes of lower level processes, realised in biological systems through
different operations having the same outcome within the context of information
control and networks.

organization and structure of communication and information management in
living organisms. This chapter will provide a short general introduction about
grammar, as well as a brief explanation on how linguistic approaches
effectively contaminate scientific practice, and, finally, how they can also
provide systems biology with further tools and paradigms to analyse emergent

0711.1193,2009-11-29,"Imposition of Different Optimizing Object with Non-Linear Constraints on
  Flux Sampling and Elimination of Free Futile Pathways","  Constraint-based modeling has been widely used on metabolic networks
analysis, such as biosynthetic prediction and flux optimization. The linear
constraints, like mass conservation constraint, reversibility constraint,
biological capacity constraint, can be imposed on linear algorithms. However,
recently a non-linear constraint based on the second thermodynamic law, known
as ""loop law"", has emerged and challenged the existing algorithms. Proven to be
unfeasible with linear solutions, this non-linear constraint has been
successfully imposed on the sampling process. In this place, Monte - Carlo
sampling with Metropolis criterion and Simulated Annealing has been introduced
to optimize the Biomass synthesis of genome scale metabolic network of
Helicobacter pylori (iIT341 GSM / GPR) under mass conservation constraint,
biological capacity constraint, and thermodynamic constraints including
reversibility and ""loop law"". The sampling method has also been employed to
optimize a non-linear objective function, the Biomass synthetic rate, which is
unified by the total income number of reducible electrons. To verify whether a
sample contains internal loops, an automatic solution has been developed based
on solving a set of inequalities. In addition, a new type of pathway has been
proposed here, the Futile Pathway, which has three properties: 1) its mass flow
could be self-balanced; 2) it has exchange reactions; 3) it is independent to
the biomass synthesis. To eliminate the fluxes of the Futile Pathways in the
sampling results, a linear programming based method has been suggested and the
results have showed improved correlations among the reaction fluxes in the
pathways related to Biomass synthesis.

  Quantitative Traits","  Robust and efficient optimization methods for variance component estimation
using Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) models for genetic mapping of
quantitative traits are considered. We show that the standard Newton-AI scheme
may fail when the optimum is located at one of the constraint boundaries, and
we introduce different approaches to remedy this by taking the constraints into
account. We approximate the Hessian of the objective function using the average
information matrix and also by using an inverse BFGS formula. The robustness
and efficiency is evaluated for problems derived from two experimental data
from the same animal populations.

with death/birth dynamics. Nodes reproduce under selection for higher payoffs
in a prisoners dilemma game played between network neighbours. The mean field
characteristics of the model are explored and an attempt is made to understand
the size dependent behaviour of the model in terms of fluctuations in the
strategy densities. We also briefly comment on the role of strategy mutation in
regulating the strategy densties.
"
0712.0973,2007-12-07,Nucleosome shape dictates chromatin-fiber structure,"  Apart from being the gateway for all access to the eukaryotic genome,
chromatin has in recent years been identified as carrying an epigenetic code
regulating transcriptional activity. The detailed knowledge of this code
contrasts the ignorance of the fiber structure which it regulates, and none of
the suggested fiber models are capable of predicting the most basic quantities
of the fiber (diameter, nucleosome line density, etc.). We address this
three-decade-old problem by constructing a simple geometrical model based on
the nucleosome shape alone. Without fit parameters we predict the observed
properties of the condensed chromatin fiber (e.g. its 30 nm diameter), the
structure, and how the fiber changes with varying nucleosome repeat length. Our
approach further puts the plethora of previously suggested models within a
coherent framework, and opens the door to detailed studies of the interplay
between chromatin structure and function.

0712.1380,2016-09-08,"Fractal scale-invariant and nonlinear properties of cardiac dynamics
  remain stable with advanced age: A new mechanistic picture of cardiac control
  in healthy elderly","  We analyze heartbeat interval recordings from two independent databases: (a)
19 healthy young (avg. age 25.7 years) and 16 healthy elderly subjects (avg.
age 73.8 years) during 2h under resting conditions from the Fantasia database;
and (b) 29 healthy elderly subjects (avg. age 75.9 years) during $\approx{}8$h
of sleep from the SHHS database, and the same subjects recorded 5 years later.
We quantify: (1) The average heart rate <RR>; (2) the SD $\sigma_{RR}$ and
$\sigma_{\Delta{}RR}$ of the heartbeat intervals RR and their increments
$\Delta{}RR$; (3) the long-range correlations in RR as measured by the scaling
exponent $\alpha_{RR}$ using the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis; (4) fractal
linear and nonlinear properties as represented by the scaling exponents
$\alpha^{sign}$ and $\alpha^{mag}$ for the time series of the sign and
magnitude of $\Delta{}RR$; (5) the nonlinear fractal dimension $D(k)$ of $RR$
using the Fractal Dimension Analysis. We find: (1) No significant difference in
$\left<RR\right>$ (P>0.05); (2) a significant difference in $\sigma_{RR}$ and
$\sigma_{\Delta{}RR}$ for the Fantasia groups (P<10^{-4}) but no significant
change with age between the elderly SHHS groups (P>0.5); (3) no significant
change in the fractal measures $\alpha_{RR}$ (P>0.15), $\alpha^{sign}$ (P>0.2),
$\alpha^{mag}$ (P>0.3), and D(k) with age. Our findings do not support the
hypothesis that fractal linear and nonlinear characteristics of heartbeat
dynamics break down with advanced age in healthy subjects. While our results
indeed show a reduced SD of heartbeat fluctuations with advanced age, the
inherent temporal fractal and nonlinear organization of these fluctuations
remains stable.

0712.1863,2007-12-13,Constructing Bio-molecular Databases on a DNA-based Computer,"  Codd [Codd 1970] wrote the first paper in which the model of a relational
database was proposed. Adleman [Adleman 1994] wrote the first paper in which
DNA strands in a test tube were used to solve an instance of the Hamiltonian
path problem. From [Adleman 1994], it is obviously indicated that for storing
information in molecules of DNA allows for an information density of
approximately 1 bit per cubic nm (nanometer) and a dramatic improvement over
existing storage media such as video tape which store information at a density
of approximately 1 bit per 1012 cubic nanometers. This paper demonstrates that
biological operations can be applied to construct bio-molecular databases where
data records in relational tables are encoded as DNA strands. In order to
achieve the goal, DNA algorithms are proposed to perform eight operations of
relational algebra (calculus) on bio-molecular relational databases, which
include Cartesian product, union, set difference, selection, projection,
intersection, join and division. Furthermore, this work presents clear evidence
of the ability of molecular computing to perform data retrieval operations on
bio-molecular relational databases.

0712.2758,2010-04-08,"Induction level determines signature of gene expression noise in
  cellular systems","  Noise in gene expression, either due to inherent stochasticity or to varying
inter- and intracellular environment, can generate significant cell-to-cell
variability of protein levels in clonal populations. We present a theoretical
framework, based on stochastic processes, to quantify the different sources of
gene expression noise taking cell division explicitly into account. Analytical,
time-dependent solutions for the noise contributions arising from the major
steps involved in protein synthesis are derived. The analysis shows that the
induction level of the activator or transcription factor is crucial for the
characteristic signature of the dominant source of gene expression noise and
thus bridges the gap between seemingly contradictory experimental results.
Furthermore, on the basis of experimentally measured cell distributions, our
simulations suggest that transcription factor binding and promoter activation
can be modelled independently of each other with sufficient accuracy.

user query is an area of active research. The present study investigates
retrieval of time series objects from a phoneme database to a given user
pattern or query. The proposed method maps the one-dimensional time series
retrieval into a sequence retrieval problem by partitioning the
multi-dimensional phase-space using k-means clustering. The problem of whole
sequence as well as subsequence matching is considered. Robustness of the
proposed technique is investigated on phoneme time series corrupted with
additive white Gaussian noise. The shortcoming of classical power-spectral
techniques for time series retrieval is also discussed.

0801.0124,2008-01-03,"Simulating Genomes and Populations in the Mutation Space: An example
  with the evolution of HIV drug resistance","  When simulating biological populations under different evolutionary genetic
models, backward or forward strategies can be followed. Backward simulations,
also called coalescent-based simulations, are computationally very efficient.
However, this framework imposes several limitations that forward simulation
does not. In this work, a new simple and efficient model to perform forward
simulation of populations and/or genomes is proposed. The basic idea considers
an individual as the differences (mutations) between this individual and a
reference or consensus genotype. Thus, this individual is no longer represented
by its complete sequence or genotype. An example of the efficiency of the new
model with respect to a more classical forward one is demonstrated. This
example models the evolution of HIV resistance using the B_FR.HXB2 reference
sequence to study the emergence of known resistance mutants to Zidovudine and
Didanosine drugs

0801.0277,2008-01-03,"Size-independent differences between the mean of discrete stochastic
  systems and the corresponding continuous deterministic systems","  In this paper I show that, for a class of reaction networks, the discrete
stochastic nature of the reacting species and reactions results in qualitative
and quantitative differences between the mean of exact stochastic simulations
and the prediction of the corresponding deterministic system. The differences
are independent of the number of molecules of each species in the system under
consideration. These reaction networks are open systems of chemical reactions
with no zero-order reaction rates systems. They are characterized by at least
two stationary points, one of which is a nonzero stable point, and one unstable
trivial solution (stability based on a linear stability analysis of the
deterministic system). Starting from a nonzero initial condition, the
deterministic system never reaches the zero stationary point due to its
unstable nature. In contrast, the result presented here proves that this
zero-state is the only stable stationary state for the discrete stochastic
system. This result generalizes previous theoretical studies and simulations of
specific systems and provides a theoretical basis for analyzing a class of
systems that exhibit such inconsistent behavior. This result has implications
in the simulation of infection, apoptosis, and population kinetics, as it can
be shown that for certain models the stochastic simulations will always yield
different predictions for the mean behavior than the deterministic simulations.

  Surveillance","  A spatiotemporal noise is assumed to reflect the environmental fluctuation in
a spatially extended tumor system. We introduce firstly the structure factor to
reveal the invasive tumor growth quantitatively. The homogenous environment can
lead to an expansive growth of the tumor cells, while the inhomogenous
environment underlies an infiltrative growth. The different responses of above
two cases are separated by a characteristic critical intensity of the
spatiotemporal noise. Theoretical and numerical results present a close

0801.1012,2008-02-21,Nemo: a computational tool for analyzing nematode locomotion,"  The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans responds to an impressive range of
chemical, mechanical and thermal stimuli and is extensively used to investigate
the molecular mechanisms that mediate chemosensation, mechanotransduction and
thermosensation. The main behavioral output of these responses is manifested as
alterations in animal locomotion. Monitoring and examination of such
alterations requires tools to capture and quantify features of nematode
movement. In this paper, we introduce Nemo (nematode movement), a
computationally efficient and robust two-dimensional object tracking algorithm
for automated detection and analysis of C. elegans locomotion. This algorithm
enables precise measurement and feature extraction of nematode movement
components. In addition, we develop a Graphical User Interface designed to
facilitate processing and interpretation of movement data. While, in this
study, we focus on the simple sinusoidal locomotion of C. elegans, our approach
can be readily adapted to handle complicated locomotory behaviour patterns by
including additional movement characteristics and parameters subject to
quantification. Our software tool offers the capacity to extract, analyze and
measure nematode locomotion features by processing simple video files. By
allowing precise and quantitative assessment of behavioral traits, this tool
will assist the genetic dissection and elucidation of the molecular mechanisms
underlying specific behavioral responses.

design requirements for the system, we developed an ecology quantification GUI
that assists biologists in analysing data. We focus on the main features of the
interface and we present the results and an evaluation of the system. Finally,
we provide some directions for some future work.

0801.2038,2008-01-15,"Biological Organization and Negative Entropy: Based on Schroedinger's
  reflections","  This paper proposes a systemic perspective for some aspects of both
phylogenesis and ontogenesis, in the light of the notion of biological
organization as negative entropy, following some hints by Schroedinger. To this
purpose, we introduce two extra principles to the thermodynamic ones, which are
(mathematically) compatible with the traditional principles, but have no
meaning in inert matter. A traditional balance equation for metabolism will be
then extended to the new notion as specified by these principles. We consider
far from equilibrium systems and we focus in particular on the production of
global entropy associated to the irreversible character of the processes. A
close analysis of this term will be carried on, both in terms of a diffusion
equation of biomass over complexity and, as a complementary approach and as a
tool for specifying a source term, in connection to Schroedinger's method for
his equation in Quantum Mechanics. We borrow from this equation just the
operatorial approach and, this, in a classical frame, as we use real
coefficients instead of complex ones, away thus from the mathematical frame of
quantum theories. The first application of our proposal is a simple
mathematical reconstruction of Gould's complexity curve of biomass over
complexity, as for evolution. We then elaborate, from the existence of
different time scales, a partition of ontogenetic time, in reference to entropy
and negative entropy variation. On the grounds of this approach, we analyze
metabolism and scaling laws. This allows to compare various relevant
coefficients appearing in these scaling laws, which seem to fit empirical data.
Finally, a tentative and quantitative evaluation of complexity is proposed,
also in relation to some empirical data (caenorhabditis elegans).

0801.2261,2008-01-16,"Predictability and epidemic pathways in global outbreaks of infectious
  diseases: the SARS case study","  Background: The global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
epidemic has clearly shown the importance of considering the long-range
transportation networks in the understanding of emerging diseases outbreaks.
The introduction of extensive transportation data sets is therefore an
important step in order to develop epidemic models endowed with realism.
Methods: We develop a general stochastic meta-population model that
incorporates actual travel and census data among 3 100 urban areas in 220
countries. The model allows probabilistic predictions on the likelihood of
country outbreaks and their magnitude. The level of predictability offered by
the model can be quantitatively analyzed and related to the appearance of
robust epidemic pathways that represent the most probable routes for the spread
of the disease. Results: In order to assess the predictive power of the model,
the case study of the global spread of SARS is considered. The disease
parameter values and initial conditions used in the model are evaluated from
empirical data for Hong Kong. The outbreak likelihood for specific countries is
evaluated along with the emerging epidemic pathways. Simulation results are in
agreement with the empirical data of the SARS worldwide epidemic. Conclusions:
The presented computational approach shows that the integration of long-range
mobility and demographic data provides epidemic models with a predictive power
that can be consistently tested and theoretically motivated. This computational
strategy can be therefore considered as a general tool in the analysis and
forecast of the global spreading of emerging diseases and in the definition of
containment policies aimed at reducing the effects of potentially catastrophic
outbreaks.

0801.2302,2008-01-16,"Towards an unifying perspective of the fundamental properties and
  structural principles governing the immune system","  In the study of the basic properties observed in the immune system and, in a
broader view, in biological systems, several concepts have already been
mathematically formulated or treated in an analytical perspective, such as
degeneracy, robustness, noise, and bow tie architecture. These properties,
among others, seem to rule many aspects of the system functioning, and share
among themselvesseveral characteristics, intersecting each other, and often
becoming one the indivisible part of the other. According to Kitano, systems
biology needs solid theoretical and methodological foundation of principles and
properties, able to lead towards a unified perspective. An effort in unifying
the formalization and analysis of these principles can be now timely attempted.

0801.4384,2008-01-30,Within-host HIV models with periodic antiretroviral therapy,"  This paper investigates the effect of drug treatment on the standard
within-host HIV model, assuming that therapy occurs periodically. It is shown
that eradication is possible under these periodic regimes, and we
quantitatively characterize successful drugs or drug combinations, both
theoretically and numerically. We also consider certain optimization problems,
motivated for instance, by the fact that eradication should be achieved at
acceptable toxicity levels to the patient. It turns out that these optimization
problems can be simplified considerably, and this makes calculations of the
optima a fairly straightforward task. All our results will be illustrated by
means of numerical examples based on up-to-date knowledge of parameter values
in the model.

0802.1750,2009-11-13,"Bifurcation analysis of a normal form for excitable media: Are stable
  dynamical alternans on a ring possible?","  We present a bifurcation analysis of a normal form for travelling waves in
one-dimensional excitable media. The normal form which has been recently
proposed on phenomenological grounds is given in form of a differential delay
equation. The normal form exhibits a symmetry preserving Hopf bifurcation which
may coalesce with a saddle-node in a Bogdanov-Takens point, and a symmetry
breaking spatially inhomogeneous pitchfork bifurcation. We study here the Hopf
bifurcation for the propagation of a single pulse in a ring by means of a
center manifold reduction, and for a wave train by means of a multiscale
analysis leading to a real Ginzburg-Landau equation as the corresponding
amplitude equation. Both, the center manifold reduction and the multiscale
analysis show that the Hopf bifurcation is always subcritical independent of
the parameters. This may have links to cardiac alternans which have so far been
believed to be stable oscillations emanating from a supercritical bifurcation.
We discuss the implications for cardiac alternans and revisit the instability
in some excitable media where the oscillations had been believed to be stable.
In particular, we show that our condition for the onset of the Hopf bifurcation
coincides with the well known restitution condition for cardiac alternans.

0802.3366,2010-12-30,The degeneracy of the genetic code and Hadamard matrices,"  The matrix form of the presentation of the genetic code is described as the
cognitive form to analyze structures of the genetic code. A similar matrix form
is utilized in the theory of signal processing. The Kronecker family of the
genetic matrices is investigated, which is based on the genetic matrix [C A; U
G], where C, A, U, G are the letters of the genetic alphabet. This matrix in
the third Kronecker power is the (8*8)-matrix, which contains 64 triplets.
Peculiarities of the degeneracy of the vertebrate mitochondria genetic code are
reflected in the symmetrical black-and-white mosaic of this genetic
(8*8)-matrix. This mosaic matrix is connected algorithmically with Hadamard
matrices unexpectedly, which are famous in the theory of signal processing,
spectral analysis, quantum mechanics and quantum computers. A special
decomposition of numeric genetic matrices reveals their close relations with a
family of 8-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (not Cayley's octonions). Some
hypothesis and thoughts are formulated on the basis of these phenomenological
facts.

0802.3744,2008-02-27,"A microstructurally informed model for the mechanical response of
  three-dimensional actin networks","  We propose a class of microstructurally informed models for the linear
elastic mechanical behavior of cross-linked polymer networks such as the actin
cytoskeleton. Salient features of the models include the possibility to
represent anisotropic mechanical behavior resulting from anisotropic filament
distributions, and a power-law scaling of the mechanical properties with the
filament density. Mechanical models within the class are parameterized by seven
different constants. We demonstrate a procedure for determining these constants
using finite element models of three-dimensional actin networks. Actin
filaments and cross-links were modeled as elastic rods, and the networks were
constructed at physiological volume fractions and at the scale of an image
voxel. We show the performance of the model in estimating the mechanical
behavior of the networks over a wide range of filament densities and degrees of
anisotropy.

0802.3854,2008-03-08,Vortices in brain waves,"  Interactions by mutual excitation in neural populations in human and animal
brains create a mesoscopic order parameter that is recorded in brain waves
(electroencephalogram, EEG). Spatially and spectrally distributed oscillations
are imposed on the background activity by inhibitory feedback in the gamma
range (30-80 Hz). Beats recur at theta rates (3-7 Hz), at which the order
parameter transiently approaches zero and microscopic activity becomes
disordered. After these null spikes, the order parameter resurges and initiates
a frame bearing a mesoscopic spatial pattern of gamma amplitude modulation that
governs the microscopic activity, and that is correlated with behavior. The
brain waves also reveal a spatial pattern of phase modulation in the form of a
cone. Using the formalism of the dissipative many-body model of brain, we
describe the null spikes and the accompanying phase cones as vortices.

0803.0888,2013-01-17,"Matrix genetics, part 1: permutations of positions in triplets and
  symmetries of genetic matrices","  The Kronecker family of the genetic matrices is investigated, which is based
on the genetic matrix [C T; A G], where C, T, A, G are the letters of the
genetic alphabet. The matrix [C T; A G] in the second Kronecker power is the
(4*4)-matrix of 16 duplets. The matrix [C T; A G] in the third Kronecker power
is the (8*8)-matrix of 64 triplets. It is significant that peculiarities of the
degeneracy of the genetic code are reflected in the symmetrical black-and-white
mosaic of these genetic matrices. The article represents interesting
mathematical properties of these mosaic matrices, which are connected with
positional permutations inside duplets and triplets; with projector operators;
with unitary matrices and cyclic groups, etc. Fractal genetic nets are proposed
as a new effective tool to study long nucleotide sequences. Some results about

  octave algebra with two quasi-real units (the genetic octave
  Yin-Yang-algebra)","  Algebraic properties of the genetic code are analyzed. The investigations of
the genetic code on the basis of matrix approaches (""matrix genetics"") are
described. The degeneracy of the vertebrate mitochondria genetic code is
reflected in the black-and-white mosaic of the (8*8)-matrix of 64 triplets, 20
amino acids and stop-signals. This mosaic genetic matrix is connected with the
matrix form of presentation of the special 8-dimensional Yin-Yang-algebra and
of its particular 4-dimensional case. The special algorithm, which is based on
features of genetic molecules, exists to transform the mosaic genomatrix into
the matrices of these algebras. Two new numeric systems are defined by these
8-dimensional and 4-dimensional algebras: genetic Yin-Yang-octaves and genetic
tetrions. Their comparison with quaternions by Hamilton is presented. Elements
of new ""genovector calculation"" and ideas of ""genetic mechanics"" are discussed.
These algebras are considered as models of the genetic code and as its possible
pre-code basis. They are related with binary oppositions of the Yin-Yang type
and they give new opportunities to investigate evolution of the genetic code.
The revealed fact of the relation between the genetic code and these genetic
algebras is discussed in connection with the idea by Pythagoras: ""All things
are numbers"". Simultaneously these genetic algebras can be utilized as the
algebras of genetic operators in biological organisms. The described results
are related with the problem of algebraization of bioinformatics. They take
attention to the question: what is life from the viewpoint of algebra?

  Scalability: How Many Biocomputing Gates Can Be Interconnected in a Circuit?","  We report an experimental evaluation of the ""input-output surface"" for a
biochemical AND gate. The obtained data are modeled within the rate-equation
approach, with the aim to map out the gate function and cast it in the language
of logic variables appropriate for analysis of Boolean logic for scalability.
In order to minimize ""analog"" noise, we consider a theoretical approach for
determining an optimal set for the process parameters to minimize ""analog""
noise amplification for gate concatenation. We establish that under optimized
conditions, presently studied biochemical gates can be concatenated for up to

0804.0682,2008-07-28,Reverse Engineering of Proteasomal Translocation Rates,"  We address the problem of proteasomal protein translocation and introduce a
new stochastic model of the proteasomal digestion (cleavage) of proteins. In
this model we account for the protein translocation and the positioning of
cleavage sites of a proteasome from first principles. We show by test examples
and by processing experimental data that our model allows reconstruction of the
translocation and cleavage rates from mass spectroscopy data on digestion
patterns and can be used to investigate the properties of transport in
different experimental set-ups. Detailed investigation with this model will
enable theoretical quantitative prediction of the proteasomal activity.

0804.2352,2008-04-16,"Run and tumble chemotaxis in a shear flow: the effect of temporal
  comparisons and other complications","  Escherichia coli is a motile bacterium that moves up a chemoattractant
gradient by performing a biased random walk composed of alternating runs and
tumbles. This paper presents calculations of the chemotactic drift velocity vd
(the mean velocity up the chemoattractant gradient) of an E. coli cell
performing chemotaxis in a uniform, steady shear flow, with a weak
chemoattractant gradient at right angles to the flow. Extending earlier models,
a combined analytic and numerical approach is used to assess the effect of
several complications, namely (i) a cell cannot detect a chemoattractant
gradient directly but rather makes temporal comparisons of chemoattractant
concentration, (ii) the tumbles exhibit persistence of direction, meaning that
the swimming directions before and after a tumble are correlated, (iii) the
cell suffers random re-orientations due to rotational Brownian motion, and (iv)
the non-spherical shape of the cell affects the way that it is rotated by the
shear flow. These complications influence the dependence of vd on the shear
rate gamma. When they are all included, it is found that (a) shear disrupts
chemotaxis and shear rates beyond gamma = 2/second cause the cell to swim down
the chemoattractant gradient rather than up it, (b) in terms of maximising
drift velocity, persistence of direction is advantageous in a quiescent fluid
but disadvantageous in a shear flow, and (c) a more elongated body shape is
advantageous in performing chemotaxis in a strong shear flow.

  System Identification in Systems Biology: the EGFR Study Case","  Identification of dynamics underlying biochemical pathways of interest in
oncology is a primary goal in current systems biology. Understanding structures
and interactions that govern the evolution of such systems is believed to be a
cornerstone in this research. Systems theory and systems identification theory
are primary resources for this task since they both provide a self consistent
framework for modelling and manipulating models of dynamical systems that are
best suited for the problem under investigation. We address herein the issue of
obtaining an informative dataset ZN to be used as starting point for
identification of EGFR pathway dynamics. In order to match experimental
identifiability criteria we propose a theoretical framework for input stimulus

feasible optofluidic design has been designed on the basis of the spectral
properties of the driving inputs that maximize information content after the
theoretical studies.

0804.3605,2010-09-16,Maximum Power Efficiency and Criticality in Random Boolean Networks,"  Random Boolean networks are models of disordered causal systems that can
occur in cells and the biosphere. These are open thermodynamic systems
exhibiting a flow of energy that is dissipated at a finite rate. Life does work
to acquire more energy, then uses the available energy it has gained to perform
more work. It is plausible that natural selection has optimized many biological
systems for power efficiency: useful power generated per unit fuel. In this
letter we begin to investigate these questions for random Boolean networks
using Landauer's erasure principle, which defines a minimum entropy cost for
bit erasure. We show that critical Boolean networks maximize available power
efficiency, which requires that the system have a finite displacement from
equilibrium. Our initial results may extend to more realistic models for cells

0804.3734,2009-11-13,Synchronization of oscillators coupled through an environment,"  We study synchronization of oscillators that are indirectly coupled through
their interaction with an environment. We give criteria for the stability or
instability of a synchronized oscillation. Using these criteria we investigate
synchronization of systems of oscillators which are weakly coupled, in the
sense that the influence of the oscillators on the environment is weak. We
prove that arbitrarily weak coupling will synchronize the oscillators, provided
that this coupling is of the 'right' sign. We illustrate our general results by
applications to a model of coupled GnRH neuron oscillators proposed by Khadra
and Li, and to indirectly weakly-coupled lambda-omega oscillators

Some biological issues are discussed.

0805.0530,2008-06-01,"Analytical Equations to the Chromaticity Cone: Algebraic Methods for
  Describing Color","  We describe an affine transformation on the (CIE) color matching functions
and map the spectral locus as a circle. We then homogenize the right circular
cylinder erected by the circle, with respect to a normalizing plane and develop
an analytical equation to the chromaticity cone, for the spectral colors. In
the interior of the (CIE) chromaticity diagram, by homogenizing elliptic
cylinders with respect to the normalizing planes, analytical equations to
subsets (also cones) of the chromaticity cone are developed. These equations
provide an algebraic method for describing color perception. As an application
of the interior chromaticity cones, we demonstrate that by sectioning
homogenized cones with planes and projecting, analytical equations to the
Macadam ellipses may be derived. Further, the cone equations are used to
propose new types of color order systems.

0805.0695,2009-11-13,The genetic code Via Godel encoding,"  The genetic code structure into distinct multiplet-classes as well as the
numeric degeneracies of the latter are revealed by a two-step process. First,
an empirical inventory of the degeneracies (of the shuffled multiplets) in two
specific equal moieties of the experimental genetic code table is made and
transcribed in the form of a sequence of integers. Second, a Godel Encoding
procedure is applied to the latter sequence delivering, as an output, a Godel
Number the digits of which, from the decimal representation, could remarkably
describe the amino acids and the stops and allow us also to compute the exact
degeneracies, class by class. The standard and the vertebrate mitochondrial
genetic codes are considered and their multiplet structure is fully
established.

0805.0819,2008-05-08,Prey-predator modeling of CO2 atmospheric concentration,"  In this work we propose a mathematical model, based in a modified version of
the Lotka-Volterra prey-predator equations, to predict the increasing in CO2
atmospheric concentration. We consider how the photosynthesis rate has changed
with the increase of CO2 and how this affects plant reproduction and CO2
absorptions rates. Total CO2 emissions (natural and manmade) and biomass
numerical parameter changes are considered. It is shown that the atmospheric
system can be in equilibrium under some specific conditions, and also some
comparisons with historical are done.

  non-linear three-compartment model","  The subject of analysis is a non-linear three-compartment model, widely used
in pharmacological absorption studies. It has been transformed into a general
form, thus leading automatically to an appropriate approximation. This made the
absorption profile accessible and expressions for absorption times, apparent
permeabilities and equilibrium values were given. These findings allowed a
profound analysis of results from non-linear curve fits and delivered the
dependencies on the systems' parameters over a wide range of values. The
results were applied to an absorption experiment with multidrug
transporter-affected antibiotic CNV97100 on Caco-2 cell monolayers.

0806.0449,2008-06-04,Anapedesis: Implications and Applications of Bio-Structural Robustness,"  Here we develop an approach to bio-structural robustness integrated with
structure-function relationship in a unified conceptual and methodological
framework, and envision its study using adequate computational and experimental
methods. To distinguish this structural robustness from the abstract
organizational robustness of systems, we call it anapedesis, and define it as
the scale-independent property of biological objects, from biomolecules to
organisms, to deform and recover while minimizing and/or repairing the damage
produced by stretch. We propose to study the consequences of deformation of
biological objects closer to their structural and/or functional failure than
previously considered relevant. We show that structural robustness is present
as a basic principle in many facets of biomedicine: many pathological
conditions may derive from the failure of molecules, cells and their
higher-order assemblies to maintain robustness against deformation.
Furthermore, structural robustness could have been the key selective criterion
during pre-biotic evolution and afterwards, and its universality can be
demonstrated by modeling using genetic algorithms. Thus, the specific
investigation of bio-structural robustness as anapedesis could help the solving
of fundamental problems of biology and medicine.

0806.0690,2008-06-05,"Phase Transitions, Chaos and Joint Action in the Life Space Foam","  This paper extends our recently developed Life Space Foam (LSF) model of
motivated cognitive dynamics \cite{IA}. LSF uses adaptive path integrals to
generate Lewinian force--fields on smooth manifolds, in order to characterize
the dynamics of individual goal--directed action. According to explanatory
theories growing in acceptance in cognitive neuroscience, one of the key
properties of this dynamics, capable of linking it to microscopic-level
cortical neurodynamics, is its meta-stability and the resulting phase
transitions. Our extended LSF model incorporates the notion of phase
transitions and complements it with embedded geometrical chaos. To describe
this LSF phase transition, a general path--integral is used, along the
corresponding LSF topology change. As a result, our extended LSF model is able
to rigorously represent co-action by two or more actors in the common
LSF--manifold. The model yields substantial qualitative differences in
geometrical properties between bilateral and multi-lateral co-action due to
intrinsic chaotic coupling between $n$ actors when $n\geq 3$.

0806.2308,2009-11-13,Dynamics and Steady States in excitable mobile agent systems,"  We study the spreading of excitations in 2D systems of mobile agents where
the excitation is transmitted when a quiescent agent keeps contact with an
excited one during a non-vanishing time. We show that the steady states
strongly depend on the spatial agent dynamics. Moreover, the coupling between
exposition time ($\omega$) and agent-agent contact rate (CR) becomes crucial to
understand the excitation dynamics, which exhibits three regimes with CR: no
excitation for low CR, an excited regime in which the number of quiescent
agents (S) is inversely proportional to CR, and for high CR, a novel third
regime, model dependent, here S scales with an exponent $\xi -1$, with $\xi$
being the scaling exponent of $\omega$ with CR.
"
0807.1943,2008-07-15,Failure of antibiotic treatment in microbial populations,"  The tolerance of bacterial populations to biocidal or antibiotic treatment
has been well documented in both biofilm and planktonic settings. However,
there is still very little known about the mechanisms that produce this
tolerance. Evidence that small, non-mutant subpopulations of bacteria are not
affected by antibiotic challenge has been accumulating and provides an
attractive explanation for the failure of typical dosing protocols. Although a
dosing challenge can kill all the susceptible bacteria, the remaining persister
cells can serve as a source of population regrowth. We give a robust condition
for the failure of a periodic dosing protocol for a general chemostat model,
which supports the mathematical conclusions and simulations of an earlier, more
specialized batch model. Our condition implies that the treatment protocol
fails globally, in the sense that a mixed bacterial population will ultimately
persist above a level that is independent of the initial composition of the
population. We also give a sufficient condition for treatment success, at least
for initial population compositions near the steady state of interest,
corresponding to bacterial washout. Finally, we investigate how the speed at
which the bacteria are wiped out depends on the duration of administration of
the antibiotic. We find that this dependence is not necessarily monotone,
implying that optimal dosing does not necessarily correspond to continuous
administration of the antibiotic. Thus, genuine periodic protocols can be more
advantageous in treating a wide variety of bacterial infections.

0807.2665,2008-07-18,"Unifying Theories of Molecular, Community and Network Evolution","  The origin of diversification and coexistence of genes and species have been
traditionally studied in isolated biological levels. Ecological and
evolutionary views have focused on the mechanisms that enable or constrain
species coexistence, genetic variation and the genetics of speciation, but a
unified theory linking those approaches is still missing. Here we introduce
evolutionary graphs in the context of neutral theories of molecular evolution
and biodiversity to provide a framework that simultaneously addresses
speciation rate and joint genetic and species diversities. To illuminate this
question we also study two models of evolution on graphs with fitness
differences, which provide insights on how genetic and ecological dynamics
drive the speed of diversification. Neutral evolution generates the highest
speed of speciation, species richness (i.e. five times and twice as many
species as compared to genetic and ecological graphs, respectively) and
genetic--species diversity (i.e., twice as many as genetic and ecological
graphs, respectively). Thus the speed of speciation, the genetic--species
diversity and coexistence can differ dramatically depending on whether genetic
factors versus ecological factors drive the evolution of the system. By linking
molecular, sexual and trophic behavior at ecological and evolutionary scales,
interacting graphs can illuminate the origin and evolution of diversity and
organismal coexistence.

0808.1371,2008-08-14,"Iron Behaving Badly: Inappropriate Iron Chelation as a Major Contributor
  to the Aetiology of Vascular and Other Progressive Inflammatory and
  Degenerative Diseases","  The production of peroxide and superoxide is an inevitable consequence of
aerobic metabolism, and while these particular ""reactive oxygen species"" (ROSs)
can exhibit a number of biological effects, they are not of themselves
excessively reactive and thus they are not especially damaging at physiological
concentrations. However, their reactions with poorly liganded iron species can
lead to the catalytic production of the very reactive and dangerous hydroxyl
radical, which is exceptionally damaging, and a major cause of chronic
inflammation. We review the considerable and wide-ranging evidence for the
involvement of this combination of (su)peroxide and poorly liganded iron in a
large number of physiological and indeed pathological processes and
inflammatory disorders, especially those involving the progressive degradation
of cellular and organismal performance. These diseases share a great many
similarities and thus might be considered to have a common cause (i.e.
iron-catalysed free radical and especially hydroxyl radical generation). The
studies reviewed include those focused on a series of cardiovascular, metabolic
and neurological diseases, where iron can be found at the sites of plaques and
lesions, as well as studies showing the significance of iron to aging and
longevity. The effective chelation of iron by natural or synthetic ligands is
thus of major physiological (and potentially therapeutic) importance. As
systems properties, we need to recognise that physiological observables have
multiple molecular causes, and studying them in isolation leads to inconsistent
patterns of apparent causality when it is the simultaneous combination of
multiple factors that is responsible. This explains, for instance, the
decidedly mixed effects of antioxidants that have been observed, etc...

"
0809.1968,2009-07-01,"Persistence, extinction and spatio-temporal synchronization of SIRS
  cellular automata models","  Spatially explicit models have been widely used in today's mathematical
ecology and epidemiology to study persistence and extinction of populations as
well as their spatial patterns. Here we extend the earlier work--static
dispersal between neighbouring individuals to mobility of individuals as well
as multi-patches environment. As is commonly found, the basic reproductive
ratio is maximized for the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) on diseases'
persistence in mean-field theory. This has important implications, as it
implies that for a wide range of parameters that infection rate will tend
maximum. This is opposite with present results obtained in spatial explicit
models that infection rate is limited by upper bound. We observe the emergence
of trade-offs of extinction and persistence on the parameters of the infection
period and infection rate and show the extinction time having a linear
relationship with respect to system size. We further find that the higher
mobility can pronouncedly promote the persistence of spread of epidemics, i.e.,
the phase transition occurs from extinction domain to persistence domain, and
the spirals' wavelength increases as the mobility increasing and ultimately, it
will saturate at a certain value. Furthermore, for multi-patches case, we find
that the lower coupling strength leads to anti-phase oscillation of infected
fraction, while higher coupling strength corresponds to in-phase oscillation.

0810.4547,2009-03-04,Hierarchies of Biocomplexity: modeling lifes energetic complexity,"  In this paper, a model for understanding the effects of selection using
systems- level computational approaches is introduced. A number of concepts and
principles essential for understanding the motivation for constructing the
model will be introduced first. This will be followed by a description of
parameters, measurements, and graphical representations used in the model. Four
possible outcomes for this model are then introduced and described. In
addition, the relationship of relative fitness to selection is described.
Finally, the consequences and potential lessons learned from the model are
discussed.

0811.2209,2013-05-29,Boolean modeling of collective effects in complex networks,"  Complex systems are often modeled as Boolean networks in attempts to capture
their logical structure and reveal its dynamical consequences. Approximating
the dynamics of continuous variables by discrete values and Boolean logic gates
may, however, introduce dynamical possibilities that are not accessible to the
original system. We show that large random networks of variables coupled
through continuous transfer functions often fail to exhibit the complex
dynamics of corresponding Boolean models in the disordered (chaotic) regime,
even when each individual function appears to be a good candidate for Boolean
idealization. A suitably modified Boolean theory explains the behavior of
systems in which information does not propagate faithfully down certain chains
of nodes. Model networks incorporating calculated or directly measured transfer
functions reported in the literature on transcriptional regulation of genes are
described by the modified theory.
"
0812.1274,2009-11-13,Probing the Mechanisms of Fibril Formation Using Lattice Models,"  Using exhaustive Monte Carlo simulations we study the kinetics and mechanism
of fibril formation using lattice models as a function of temperature and the
number of chains. While these models are, at best, caricatures of peptides, we
show that a number of generic features thought to govern fibril assembly are
present in the toy model. The monomer, which contains eight beads made from
three letters (hydrophobic, polar, and charged), adopts a compact conformation
in the native state. The kinetics of fibril assembly occurs in three distinct
stages. In each stage there is a cascade of events that transforms the monomers
and oligomers to ordered structures. In the first ""burst"" stage highly mobile
oligomers of varying sizes form. The conversion to the aggregation-prone
conformation occurs within the oligomers during the second stage. As time
progresses, a dominant cluster emerges that contains a majority of the chains.
In the final stage, the aggregation-prone conformation particles serve as a
template onto which smaller oligomers or monomers can dock and undergo
conversion to fibril structures. The overall time for growth in the latter
stages is well described by the Lifshitz-Slyazov growth kinetics for
crystallization from super-saturated solutions.

0902.0312,2009-02-03,Comparing bird and human soaring strategies,"  Gliding saves much energy, and to make large distances using only this form
of flight represents a great challenge for both birds and people. The solution
is to make use of the so-called thermals, which are localized, warmer regions
in the atmosphere moving upwards with a speed exceeding the descent rate of
bird and plane. Whereas birds use this technique mainly for foraging, humans do
it as a sporting activity. Thermalling involves efficient optimization
including the skilful localization of thermals, trying to guess the most
favorable route, estimating the best descending rate, etc. In this study, we
address the question whether there are any analogies between the solutions
birds and humans find to handle the above task. High-resolution track logs were
taken from thermalling falcons and paraglider pilots to determine the essential
parameters of the flight patterns. We find that there are relevant common
features in the ways birds and humans use thermals. In particular, falcons seem
to reproduce the MacCready formula widely used by gliders to calculate the best
slope to take before an upcoming thermal.

0902.0389,2009-11-13,"Fluorescent nanodiamonds for FRET-based monitoring of a single
  biological nanomotor FoF1-ATP synthase","  Color centers in diamond nanocrystals are a new class of fluorescence markers
that attract significant interest due to matchless brightness, photostability
and biochemical inertness. Fluorescing diamond nanocrystals containing defects
can be used as markers replacing conventional organic dye molecules, quantum
dots or autofluorescent proteins. They can be applied for tracking and
ultrahigh-resolution localization of the single markers. In addition the spin
properties of diamond defects can be utilized for novel magneto-optical imaging
(MOI) with nanometer resolution. We develop this technique to unravel the
details of the rotary motions and the elastic energy storage mechanism of a
single biological nanomotor FoF1-ATP synthase. FoF1-ATP synthase is the enzyme
that provides the 'chemical energy currency' adenosine triphosphate, ATP, for
living cells. The formation of ATP is accomplished by a stepwise internal
rotation of subunits within the enzyme. Previously subunit rotation has been
monitored by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and
was limited by the photostability of the fluorophores. Fluorescent nanodiamonds
advance these FRET measurements to long time scales.

0902.0490,2009-03-31,"Existence of biological uncertainty principle implies that we can never
  find 'THE' measure for biological complexity","  There are innumerable 'biological complexity measure's. While some patterns
emerge from these attempts to represent biological complexity, a single measure
to encompass the seemingly countless features of biological systems, still
eludes the students of Biology. It is the pursuit of this paper to discuss the
feasibility of finding one complete and objective measure for biological
complexity. A theoretical construct (the 'Thread-Mesh model') is proposed here
to describe biological reality. It segments the entire biological space-time in
a series of different biological organizations before modeling the property
space of each of these organizations with computational and topological
constructs. Acknowledging emergence as a key biological property, it has been
proved here that the quest for an objective and all-encompassing biological
complexity measure would necessarily end up in failure. Since any study of
biological complexity is rooted in the knowledge of biological reality, an
expression for possible limit of human knowledge about ontological biological
reality, in the form of an uncertainty principle, is proposed here. Two
theorems are proposed to model the fundamental limitation, owing to observer
dependent nature of description of biological reality. They explain the reasons
behind failures to construct a single and complete biological complexity
measure. This model finds support in various experimental results and therefore
provides a reliable and general way to study biological complexity and
biological reality.

0902.0664,2011-11-28,"A (possible) mathematical model to describe biological
  ""context-dependence"" : case study with protein structure","  Context-dependent nature of biological phenomena are well documented in every
branch of biology. While there have been few previous attempts to (implicitly)
model various facets of biological context-dependence, a formal and general
mathematical construct to model the wide spectrum of context-dependence, eludes
the students of biology. An objective and rigorous model, from both 'bottom-up'
as well as 'top-down' perspective, is proposed here to serve as the template to
describe the various kinds of context-dependence that we encounter in different
branches of biology. Interactions between biological contexts was found to be
transitive but non-commutative. It is found that a hierarchical nature of
dependence amongst the biological contexts models the emergent biological
properties efficiently. Reasons for these findings are provided with a general
model to describe biological reality. Scheme to algorithmically implement the
hierarchic structure of organization of biological contexts was achieved with a
construct named 'Context tree'. A 'Context tree' based analysis of context
interactions among biophysical factors influencing protein structure was
performed.

0902.3919,2009-09-23,Cellular Automata Model of Macroevolution,"  In this paper I describe a cellular automaton model of a multi-species
ecosystem, suitable for the study of emergent properties of macroevolution.
Unlike majority of ecological models, the number of coexisting species is not
fixed. Starting from one common ancestor they appear by ""mutations"" of existent
species, and then survive or extinct depending on the balance of local
ecological interactions. Monte-Carlo numerical simulations show that this model
is able to qualitatively reproduce phenomena that have been observed in other
models and in nature.

0903.1753,2015-05-13,Non-neutral theory of biodiversity,"  We present a non-neutral stochastic model for the dynamics taking place in a
meta-community ecosystems in presence of migration. The model provides a
framework for describing the emergence of multiple ecological scenarios and
behaves in two extreme limits either as the unified neutral theory of
biodiversity or as the Bak-Sneppen model. Interestingly, the model shows a
condensation phase transition where one species becomes the dominant one, the
diversity in the ecosystems is strongly reduced and the ecosystem is
non-stationary. This phase transition extend the principle of competitive
exclusion to open ecosystems and might be relevant for the study of the impact
of invasive species in native ecologies.

0904.0376,2010-03-31,"A new simulation-based model for calculating post-mortem intervals using
  developmental data for Lucilia sericata (Dipt.: Calliphoridae)","  Homicide investigations often depend on the determination of a minimum
post-mortem interval (PMI$_{min}$) by forensic entomologists. The age of the
most developed insect larvae (mostly blow fly larvae) gives reasonably reliable
information about the minimum time a person has been dead. Methods such as
isomegalen diagrams or ADH calculations can have problems in their reliability,
so we established in this study a new growth model to calculate the larval age
of \textit{Lucilia sericata} (Meigen 1826). This is based on the actual
non-linear development of the blow fly and is designed to include
uncertainties, e.g. for temperature values from the crime scene. We used
published data for the development of \textit{L. sericata} to estimate
non-linear functions describing the temperature dependent behavior of each
developmental state. For the new model it is most important to determine the
progress within one developmental state as correctly as possible since this
affects the accuracy of the PMI estimation by up to 75%. We found that PMI
calculations based on one mean temperature value differ by up to 65% from PMIs
based on an 12-hourly time temperature profile. Differences of 2\degree C in
the estimation of the crime scene temperature result in a deviation in PMI
calculation of 15 - 30%.

0904.1215,2009-08-23,"Tree diameter, height and stocking in even-aged forests","  Empirical observations suggest that in pure even-aged forests, the mean
diameter of forest trees (D, diameter at breast height, 1.3 m above ground)
tends to remain a constant proportion of stand height (H, average height of the
largest trees in a stand) divided by the logarithm of stand density (N, number
of trees per hectare): D = beta (H-1.3)/Ln(N). Thinning causes a relatively
small and temporary change in the slope beta, the magnitude and duration of
which depends on the nature of the thinning. This relationship may provide a
robust predictor of growth in situations where scarce data and resources
preclude more sophisticated modelling approaches.
"
0904.3111,2009-05-11,On Pattern and Evolution,"  A model of pattern formation in living systems is presented. The pattern is
achieved by the sequential interaction of two signaling pathways. The coupling
of the pattern to the (thick) epithelial sheet changes is given, when the Gauss
curvature'K'enters. The model suggests a novel point-like placement for organs
such as eyes, antennae, limbs, and wings. In the case of plant patterns, 'leaf'
outgrowths from a stem are predicted to be under the control of a yet to be
discovered ""master regulatiory gene"", analogous to the animal case, when
various outgrowths from the animal body are generally accompanied by activation
of the 'distal-less' (Dll) gene.

0904.3396,2009-04-23,Sparse Approximation of Computational Time Reversal Imaging,"  Computational time reversal imaging can be used to locate the position of
multiple scatterers in a known background medium. Here, we discuss a sparse
approximation method for computational time-reversal imaging. The method is
formulated entirely in the frequency domain, and besides imaging it can also be
used for denoising, and to determine the magnitude of the scattering
coefficients in the presence of moderate noise levels.

0905.2932,2013-05-29,Optimality Properties of a Proposed Precursor to the Genetic Code,"  We calculate the optimality of a doublet precursor to the canonical genetic
code with respect to mitigating the effects of point mutations and compare our
results to corresponding ones for the canonical genetic code. We find that the
proposed precursor has much less optimality than that of the canonical code.
Our results render unlikely the notion that the doublet precursor was an
intermediate state in the evolution of the canonical genetic code. These
findings support the notion that code optimality reflects evolutionary
dynamics, and that if such a doublet code originally had a biochemical
significance, it arose before the emergence of translation.

the dissipative model of brain is shown to account for the self-similarity in

spectral densities of electrocorticograms. I also briefly discuss the

0906.0886,2009-06-05,"Leaf litter decomposition -- Estimates of global variability based on
  Yasso07 model","  Litter decomposition is an important process in the global carbon cycle. It
accounts for most of the heterotrophic soil respiration and results in
formation of more stable soil organic carbon (SOC) which is the largest
terrestrial carbon stock. Litter decomposition may induce remarkable feedbacks
to climate change because it is a climate-dependent process. To investigate the
global patterns of litter decomposition, we developed a description of this
process and tested the validity of this description using a large set of foliar
litter mass loss measurements (nearly 10 000 data points derived from
approximately 70 000 litter bags). We applied the Markov chain Monte Carlo
method to estimate uncertainty in the parameter values and results of our model
called Yasso07. The model appeared globally applicable. It estimated the
effects of litter type (plant species) and climate on mass loss with little
systematic error over the first 10 decomposition years, using only initial
litter chemistry, air temperature and precipitation as input variables.
Illustrative of the global variability in litter mass loss rates, our example
calculations showed that a typical conifer litter had 68% of its initial mass
still remaining after two decomposition years in tundra while a deciduous
litter had only 15% remaining in the tropics. Uncertainty in these estimates, a
direct result of the uncertainty of the parameter values of the model, varied
according to the distribution of the litter bag data among climate conditions
and ranged from 2% in tundra to 4% in the tropics. This reliability was
adequate to use the model and distinguish the effects of even small differences
in litter quality or climate conditions on litter decomposition as
statistically significant.

0906.0917,2009-06-05,"Vaccination against rubella: Analysis of the temporal evolution of the
  age-dependent force of infection and the effects of different contact
  patterns","  In this paper, we analyze the temporal evolution of the age-dependent force
of infection and incidence of rubella, after the introduction of a very
specific vaccination programme in a previously nonvaccinated population where
rubella was in endemic steady state. We deduce an integral equation for the
age-dependent force of infection, which depends on a number of parameters that
can be estimated from the force of infection in steady state prior to the
vaccination program. We present the results of our simulations, which are
compared with observed data. We also examine the influence of contact patterns
among members of a community on the age-dependent intensity of transmission of
rubella and on the results of vaccination strategies. As an example of the
theory proposed, we calculate the effects of vaccination strategies for four
communities from Caieiras (Brazil), Huixquilucan (Mexico), Finland and the
United Kingdom. The results for each community differ considerably according to
the distinct intensity and pattern of transmission in the absence of
vaccination. We conclude that this simple vaccination program is not very
efficient (very slow) in the goal of eradicating the disease. This gives
support to a mixed strategy, proposed by Massad et al., accepted and
implemented by the government of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
"
0906.1477,2015-05-13,Mechanics of Reversible Unzipping,"  We study the mechanics of a reversible decohesion (unzipping) of an elastic
layer subjected to quasi-static end-point loading. At the micro level the
system is simulated by an elastic chain of particles interacting with a rigid
foundation through breakable springs. Such system can be viewed as prototypical
for the description of a wide range of phenomena from peeling of polymeric
tapes, to rolling of cells, working of gecko's fibrillar structures and
denaturation of DNA. We construct a rigorous continuum limit of the discrete
model which captures both stable and metastable configurations and present a
detailed parametric study of the interplay between elastic and cohesive
interactions. We show that the model reproduces the experimentally observed
abrupt transition from an incremental evolution of the adhesion front to a
sudden complete decohesion of a macroscopic segment of the adhesion layer. As
the microscopic parameters vary the macroscopic response changes from
quasi-ductile to quasi-brittle, with corresponding decrease in the size of the
adhesion hysteresis. At the micro-scale this corresponds to a transition from a
`localized' to a `diffuse' structure of the decohesion front (domain wall). We
obtain an explicit expression for the critical debonding threshold in the limit
when the internal length scales are much smaller than the size of the system.
The achieved parametric control of the microscopic mechanism can be used in the
design of new biological inspired adhesion devices and machines.

0906.3319,2009-06-19,"Rapid emergence of co-colonization with community-acquired and
  hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains in the
  hospital setting","  Background: Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(CA-MRSA), a novel strain of MRSA, has recently emerged and rapidly spread in
the community. Invasion into the hospital setting with replacement of the
hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) has also been documented. Co-colonization with
both CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA would have important clinical implications given
differences in antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and the potential for
exchange of genetic information.
  Methods: A deterministic mathematical model was developed to characterize the
transmission dynamics of HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA in the hospital setting and to
quantify the emergence of co-colonization with both strains.
  Results: The model analysis shows that the state of co-colonization becomes
endemic over time and that there is no competitive exclusion of either strain.
Increasing the length of stay or rate of hospital entry among patients
colonized with CA-MRSA leads to a rapid increase in the co-colonized state.
Compared to MRSA decolonization strategy, improving hand hygiene compliance has
the greatest impact on decreasing the prevalence of HA-MRSA, CA-MRSA and the
co-colonized state.
  Conclusions: The model predicts that with the expanding community reservoir
of CA-MRSA, the majority of hospitalized patients will become colonized with
both CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA.

0907.0040,2014-03-03,Thermodynamic Function of Life,"  Darwinian Theory depicts life as being overwhelmingly consumed by a fight for
survival in a hostile environment. However, from a thermodynamic perspective,
life is a dynamic, out of equilibrium process, stabilizing and coevolving in
concert with its abiotic environment. The living component of the biosphere of
greatest mass, the plants and cyanobacteria, are involved in the transpiration
of vast amounts of water. Transpiration is part of the global water cycle, and
it is this cycle that distinguishes Earth from its apparently life barren
neighboring planets, Venus and Mars. The water cycle, including the absorption
of sunlight in the biosphere, is by far the greatest entropy producing process
occurring on Earth. Life, from this perspective, can therefore be viewed as
performing an important thermodynamic function; acting as a dynamic catalyst by
aiding process such as the water cycle, hurricanes, and ocean and wind currents
to produce entropy. The role of animals in this view is that of unwitting but
dedicated servants of the plants and cyanobacteria, helping them to grow and to
spread into initially inhospitable areas.
"
0907.0042,2014-03-03,Thermodynamic Origin of Life,"  Understanding the thermodynamic function of life may shed light on its
origin. Life, as are all irreversible processes, is contingent on entropy
production. Entropy production is a measure of the rate of the tendency of
Nature to explore available microstates. The most important irreversible
process generating entropy in the biosphere, and thus facilitating this
exploration, is the absorption and transformation of sunlight into heat. Here
we hypothesize that life began, and persists today, as a catalyst for the
absorption and dissipation of sunlight at the surface of shallow seas. The
resulting heat is then efficiently harvested by other irreversible processes
such as the water cycle, hurricanes, and ocean and wind currents. RNA and DNA
are the most efficient of all known molecules for absorbing the intense
ultraviolet light that could have penetrated the dense early atmosphere, and
are remarkably rapid in transforming this light into heat in the presence of
liquid water. From this perspective, the origin and evolution of life,
inseparable from water and the water cycle, can be understood as resulting from
the natural thermodynamic imperative of increasing the entropy production of
the Earth in its interaction with its solar environment. A mechanism is
proposed for the reproduction of RNA and DNA without the need for enzymes,
promoted instead through UV light dissipation and the ambient conditions of
prebiotic Earth.

0907.3537,2009-07-22,"A Molecular Mass Gradient is the Key Parameter of the Genetc Code
  Organization","  The structure of the genetic code is discussed in formal terms. A rectangular
table of the code (""the code matrix""), whose properties reveal its arithmetical
content tagged with the information symbols in several notations. New
parameters used to analyze of the code matrix, the serial numbers of the
encoded products and coding elements, ordered by molecular mass. The structural
similarity of the amino acid sequences corresponding to two aminoacyl tRNA
synthetases classes is found. The code matrix shows how can be organized the
so-called second genetic code. The symmetrical pattern of the matrix is
supported with the other parameters; it also serves as a basis to construct a
3D model of the genetic code which follows the structure of the simplest Plato
solid, tetrahedron. The reasons for this unusual structure of the genetic code
remains unclear.
"
0907.3964,2009-07-24,The structure of human olfactory space,"  We analyze the psychophysical responses of human observers to an ensemble of
monomolecular odorants. Each odorant is characterized by a set of 146
perceptual descriptors obtained from a database of odor character profiles.
Each odorant is therefore represented by a point in highly multidimensional
sensory space. In this work we study the arrangement of odorants in this
perceptual space. We argue that odorants densely sample a two-dimensional
curved surface embedded in the multidimensional sensory space. This surface can
account for more than half of the variance of the psychophysical data. We also
show that only 12 percent of experimental variance cannot be explained by
curved surfaces of substantially small dimensionality (<10). We suggest that
these curved manifolds represent the relevant spaces sampled by the human
olfactory system, thereby providing surrogates for olfactory sensory space. For
the case of 2D approximation, we relate the two parameters on the curved
surface to the physico-chemical parameters of odorant molecules. We show that
one of the dimensions is related to eigenvalues of the molecule connectivity
matrix, while the other is correlated with measures of the molecule polarity.
We discuss the behavioral significance of these findings.

0908.0411,2009-12-15,Data management in systems biology I - Overview and bibliography,"  Large systems biology projects can encompass several workgroups often located
in different countries. An overview about existing data standards in systems
biology and the management, storage, exchange and integration of the generated
data in large distributed research projects is given, the pros and cons of the
different approaches are illustrated from a practical point of view, the
existing software - open source as well as commercial - and the relevant
literature is extensively overview, so that the reader should be enabled to
decide which data management approach is the best suited for his special needs.
An emphasis is laid on the use of workflow systems and of TAB-based formats.
The data in this format can be viewed and edited easily using spreadsheet
programs which are familiar to the working experimental biologists. The use of
workflows for the standardized access to data in either own or publicly
available databanks and the standardization of operation procedures is
presented. The use of ontologies and semantic web technologies for data
management will be discussed in a further paper.

degeneracies of the five multiplets without any trick for the doublets and the
sextets, as we have done previously. We give also some interesting
applications.

  codon usage","  The tendencies described in this work were revealed in the course of
examination of adenine and uracil distribution in the mRNA encoding sequence.
The study also discusses the usage of codons occupied by the amino acid
arginine in the table of the universal genetic code. All of the described
tendencies are qualitative, so neither sophisticated methods nor cumbersome
calculations are necessary to reveal and interpret them.

0908.1515,2010-01-20,"Integration of a Phosphatase Cascade with the MAP Kinase Pathway
  provides for a Novel Signal Processing Function","  We mathematically modeled the receptor-activated MAP kinase signaling by
incorporating the regulation through cellular phosphatases. Activation induced
the alignment of a phosphatase cascade in parallel with the MAP kinase pathway.
A novel regulatory motif was thus generated, providing for the combinatorial
control of each MAPK intermediate. This ensured a non-linear mode of signal
transmission with the output being shaped by the balance between the strength
of input signal, and the activity gradient along the phosphatase axis. Shifts
in this balance yielded modulations in topology of the motif, thereby expanding
the repertoire of output responses. Thus we identify an added dimension to
signal processing, wherein the output response to an external stimulus is
additionally filtered through indicators that define the phenotypic status of
the cell.
"
0908.1960,2010-09-17,"A Fokker-Planck formalism for diffusion with finite increments and
  absorbing boundaries","  Gaussian white noise is frequently used to model fluctuations in physical
systems. In Fokker-Planck theory, this leads to a vanishing probability density
near the absorbing boundary of threshold models. Here we derive the boundary
condition for the stationary density of a first-order stochastic differential
equation for additive finite-grained Poisson noise and show that the response
properties of threshold units are qualitatively altered. Applied to the
integrate-and-fire neuron model, the response turns out to be instantaneous
rather than exhibiting low-pass characteristics, highly non-linear, and
asymmetric for excitation and inhibition. The novel mechanism is exhibited on
the network level and is a generic property of pulse-coupled systems of
threshold units.

0908.3037,2019-07-10,Parameter estimation for Boolean models of biological networks,"  Boolean networks have long been used as models of molecular networks and play
an increasingly important role in systems biology. This paper describes a
software package, Polynome, offered as a web service, that helps users
construct Boolean network models based on experimental data and biological
input. The key feature is a discrete analog of parameter estimation for
continuous models. With only experimental data as input, the software can be
used as a tool for reverse-engineering of Boolean network models from
experimental time course data.
"
0908.3067,2009-08-24,A Unified Theory on Construction and Evolution of the Genetic Code,"  A quantitative theory on the construction and the evolution of the genetic
code is proposed. Through introducing the concept of mutational deterioration
(MD) and developing a theoretical formalism on MD minimization we have proved:
1, the redundancy distribution of codons in the genetic code obeys MD
minimization principle; 2, the hydrophilic-hydrophobic distribution of amino
acids on the code table is global MD (GMD) minimal; 3, the standard genetic
code can be deduced from the adaptive minimization of GMD; 4, the variants of
the standard genetic code can be explained quantitatively by use of GMD
formalism and the general trend of the evolution is GMD non-increasing which
reflects the selection on the code. We have demonstrated that the redundancy
distribution of codons and the hydrophobic-hydrophilic (H-P) distribution of
amino acids are robust in the code relative to the mutational parameter, and
indicated that the GMD can be looked as a non-fitness function on the adaptive
landscape. Finally, an important aspect on the symmetry of the code
construction, the Yin-Yang duality is investigated. The Yin-Yang duality among
codons affords a sound basis for understanding the H-P structure in the genetic
code.

0909.1583,2010-10-12,Towards Biosensing Strategies Based on Biochemical Logic Systems,"  Recent advances in biochemical computing, i.e., information processing with
cascades of primarily enzymatic reactions realizing computing gates, such as
AND, OR, etc., as well as progress in networking these gates and coupling of
the resulting systems to smart/responsive electrodes for output readout, have
opened new biosensing opportunities. Here we survey existing enabling research
results, as well as ideas and research avenues for future development of a new
paradigm of digitally operating biosensors logically processing multiple
biochemical signals through Boolean logic networks composed of biomolecular
reactions, yielding the final output signals as YES/NO responses. Such systems
can lead to high-fidelity biosensing compared to common single or parallel
sensing devices.

0909.2676,2009-11-17,Coherent and Noncoherent Photonic Communications in Biological Systems,"  The possible mechanisms of communications between distant bio-systems by
means of optical and UV photons are studied. It is argued that their main
production mechanism is owed to the biochemical reactions, occurring during the
cell division.. In the proposed model the bio-systems perform such
communications, radiating the photons in form of short periodic bursts, which
were observed experimentally for fish and frog eggs1. For experimentally
measured photon rates the communication algorithm is supposedly similar to the
exchange of binary encoded data in computer net via optical channels
"
0909.4015,2009-09-23,"Multiple positive steady states in subnetworks defined by stoichiometric
  generators","  In Systems Biology there is a growing interest in the question, whether or
not a given mathematical model can admit more than one steady state. As
parameter values are often unknown or subject to a very high uncertainty, one
is often interested in the question, whether or not a given mathematical model
can, for some conceivable parameter vector, exhibit multistationarity at all. A
partial answer to this question is given in Feinberg's deficiency one
algorithm. This algorithm can decide about multistationarity by analyzing
systems of linear inequalities that are independent of parameter values.
However, the deficiency one algorithm is limited to what its author calls
regular deficiency one networks. Many realistic networks have a deficiency
higher than one, thus the algorithm cannot be applied directly. In a previous
publication it was suggested to analyze certain well defined subnetworks that
are guaranteed to be of deficiency one. Realistic reaction networks, however,
often lead to subnetworks that are irregular, especially if metabolic networks
are considered. Here the special structure of the subnetworks is used to derive
conditions for multistationarity. These conditions are independent of the
regularity conditions required by the deficiency one algorithm. Thus, in
particular, these conditions are applicable to irregular subnetworks.

and scars formation on virus capsids. The possibility that scars could explain
certain data recently obtained by Sundquist's group in electron cryotomography
of immature HIV-1 virions is also briefly addressed. Furthermore, a bottom-up
reflection is presented on the need to invent new physics to pave the way to a

0910.3146,2009-10-19,"A Hybrid Agent Based and Differential Equation Model of Body Size
  Effects on Pathogen Replication and Immune System Response","  Many emerging pathogens infect multiple host species, and multi-host
pathogens may have very different dynamics in different host species. This
research addresses how pathogen replication rates and Immune System (IS)
response times are constrained by host body size. An Ordinary Differential
Equation (ODE) model is used to show that pathogen replication rates decline
with host body size but IS response rates remain invariant with body size. An
Agent-Based Model (ABM) is used to investigate two models of IS architecture
that could explain scale invariance of IS response rates. A stage structured
hybrid model is proposed that strikes a balance between the detailed
representation of an ABM and computational tractability of an ODE, by using
them in the initial and latter stages of an infection, respectively.

0910.5834,2009-11-02,Scaling of human body mass with height: the Body Mass Index revisited,"  We adapt a biomechanical argument of Rashevsky, which places limits on the
stress experienced by a torso supported by the legs, to deduce that body mass
$m$ of growing children should scale as the $p$th power of height $h$ with
$7/3<p<8/3$. Further arguments based on stability and heat loss suggest that
$p$ should be close to 8/3. The arguments are extended to suggest that waist
circumference $w$ should scale as $h^q$ with $q$ near the lower end of $2/3\leq
q \leq 1$. Data from Hong Kong and British children are consistent with these
hypotheses.

0911.0188,2009-11-03,Differential Operator in Seizure Detection,"  Differential operators can detect significant changes in signals. This has
been utilized to enhance the contrast of the seizure signatures in depth EEG or
ECoG. We have actually taken normalized exponential of absolute value of single
or double derivative of epileptic ECoG. Variance operation has been performed
to automatically detect seizures. A novel method for determining the duration
of seizure has also been proposed. Since all operations take only linear time,
the whole method is extremely fast. Seven novel parameters have been introduced
whose patient specific thresholding brings down the rate of false detection to
a bare minimum. Results of implementation on the ECoG data of four epileptic
patients have been reported with an ROC curve analysis. High value of the area
under the ROC curve indicates excellent detection performance.
"
0911.0344,2009-11-03,Accelerating the pace of discovery by changing the peer review algorithm,"  The number of scientific publications is constantly rising, increasing the
strain on the review process. The number of submissions is actually higher, as
each manuscript is often reviewed several times before publication. To face the
deluge of submissions, top journals reject a considerable fraction of
manuscripts without review, potentially declining manuscripts with merit. The
situation is frustrating for authors, reviewers and editors alike. Recently,
several editors wrote about the ``tragedy of the reviewer commons', advocating
for urgent corrections to the system. Almost every scientist has ideas on how
to improve the system, but it is very difficult, if not impossible, to perform
experiments to test which measures would be most effective. Surprisingly,
relatively few attempts have been made to model peer review. Here I implement a
simulation framework in which ideas on peer review can be quantitatively
tested. I incorporate authors, reviewers, manuscripts and journals into an
agent-based model and a peer review system emerges from their interactions. As
a proof-of-concept, I contrast an implementation of the current system, in
which authors decide the journal for their submissions, with a system in which
journals bid on manuscripts for publication. I show that, all other things
being equal, this latter system solves most of the problems currently
associated with the peer review process. Manuscripts' evaluation is faster,
authors publish more and in better journals, and reviewers' effort is optimally
utilized. However, more work is required from editors. This modeling framework
can be used to test other solutions for peer review, leading the way for an
improvement of how science is disseminated.

regarding all substructures of the universe. Life science is regarded as a
science of the 21st century and one can expect great new discoveries in the
near futures. This article contains an introductory brief review of genetic
information, its coding and translation of genes to proteins through the
genetic code. Some theoretical approaches to the modelling of the genetic code
are presented. In particular, connection of the genetic code with number theory
is considered and the role of $p$-adic numbers is underlined.
"
0912.1672,2011-08-09,Are mental properties supervenient on brain properties?,"  The ""mind-brain supervenience"" conjecture suggests that all mental properties
are derived from the physical properties of the brain. To address the question
of whether the mind supervenes on the brain, we frame a supervenience
hypothesis in rigorous statistical terms. Specifically, we propose a modified
version of supervenience (called epsilon-supervenience) that is amenable to
experimental investigation and statistical analysis. To illustrate this
approach, we perform a thought experiment that illustrates how the
probabilistic theory of pattern recognition can be used to make a one-sided
determination of epsilon-supervenience. The physical property of the brain
employed in this analysis is the graph describing brain connectivity (i.e., the
brain-graph or connectome). epsilon-supervenience allows us to determine
whether a particular mental property can be inferred from one's connectome to
within any given positive misclassification rate, regardless of the
relationship between the two. This may provide motivation for
cross-disciplinary research between neuroscientists and statisticians.

  Viruses","  Viruses utilize various means to circumvent the immune detection in the
biological systems. Several mathematical models have been investigated for the
description of viral dynamics in the biological system of human and various
other species. One common strategy for evasion and recognition of viruses is,
through acquaintance in the systems by means of search engines. In this
perspective a search tool have been developed to provide a wider comprehension
about the structure and other details on viruses which have been narrated in
this paper. This provides an adequate knowledge in evolution and building of

of data and how this can contribute to the vision of the semantic web to become
true. The problems existing today on the way to a true semantic web are
pinpointed, different semantic web standards, tools and development frameworks

0912.2908,2010-01-04,"Control and ultrasonic actuation of a gas-liquid interface in a
  microfluidic chip","  This article describes the design and manufacturing of a microfluidic chip,
allowing for the actuation of a gas-liquid interface and of the neighboring
fluid. A first way to control the interface motion is to apply a pressure
difference across it. In this case, the efficiency of three different
micro-geometries at anchoring the interface is compared. Also, the critical
pressures needed to move the interface are measured and compared to theoretical
result. A second way to control the interface motion is by ultrasonic
excitation. When the excitation is weak, the interface exhibits traveling
waves, which follow a dispersion equation. At stronger ultrasonic levels,
standing waves appear on the interface, with frequencies that are half integer
multiple of the excitation frequency. An associated microstreaming flow field
observed in the vicinity of the interface is characterized. The meniscus and
associated streaming flow have the potential to transport particles and mix
reagents.

  route M6/M74 through Newcastle","  Plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a single cell visible by unaided eye.
During its foraging behaviour the cell spans spatially distributed sources of
nutrients with a protoplasmic network. Geometrical structure of the
protoplasmic networks allows the plasmodium to optimize transfer of nutrients
between remote parts of its body, to distributively sense its environment, and
make a decentralized decision about further routes of migration. We consider
the ten most populated urban areas in United Kingdom and study what would be an
optimal layout of transport links between these urban areas from the
""plasmodium's point of view"". We represent geographical locations of urban
areas by oat flakes, inoculate the plasmodium in Greater London area and
analyse the plasmodium's foraging behaviour. We simulate the behaviour of the
plasmodium using a particle collective which responds to the environmental
conditions to construct and minimise transport networks. Results of our scoping
experiments show that during its colonization of the experimental space the
plasmodium forms a protoplasmic network isomorphic to a network of major
motorways except the motorway linking England with Scotland. We also imitate
the reaction of transport network to disastrous events and show how the
transport network can be reconfigured during natural or artificial cataclysms.
The results of the present research lay a basis for future science of
bio-inspired urban and road planning.

1001.3768,2013-10-07,Human strategy updating in evolutionary games,"  Evolutionary game dynamics describes not only frequency dependent genetical
evolution, but also cultural evolution in humans. In this context, successful
strategies spread by imitation. It has been shown that the details of strategy
update rules can have a crucial impact on evolutionary dynamics in theoretical
models and e.g. significantly alter the level of cooperation in social
dilemmas. But what kind of strategy update rules can describe imitation
dynamics in humans? Here, we present a way to measure such strategy update
rules in a behavioral experiment. We use a setting in which individuals are
virtually arranged on a spatial lattice. This produces a large number of
different strategic situations from which we can assess strategy updating. Most
importantly, spontaneous strategy changes corresponding to mutations or
exploration behavior are more frequent than assumed in many models. Our
experimental approach to measure properties of the update mechanisms used in
theoretical models will be useful for mathematical models of cultural
evolution.
"
1001.3878,2013-05-29,Epidemic spreading in evolving networks,"  A model for epidemic spreading on rewiring networks is introduced and
analyzed for the case of scale free steady state networks. It is found that
contrary to what one would have naively expected, the rewiring process
typically tends to suppress epidemic spreading. In particular it is found that
as in static networks, rewiring networks with degree distribution exponent
$\gamma >3$ exhibit a threshold in the infection rate below which epidemics die
out in the steady state. However the threshold is higher in the rewiring case.
For $2<\gamma \leq 3$ no such threshold exists, but for small infection rate
the steady state density of infected nodes (prevalence) is smaller for rewiring
networks.

  pulvereceus","  Extra cellular alkaline protease producing species is an isolate from soil
which was characterized and identified as Streptomyces pulvereceus MTCC 8374.
Studies on submerged fermentation revealed that maximum level of enzyme
production was during early stationary phase. Optimum pH, inoculum and
temperature were 9.0, 3 percent and 33 C respectively. Among carbon sources 0.3
peccent starch gave a maximum production followed by maltose, xylose and
fructose. High yield of protease production was reported with 1.0 percent
casein followed by soybean meal, yeast extract and malt extract. Further, it
was optimized with 0.5 percent, 1.0 percentand 1.5 percent of NaCl among which
1 percent NaCl resulted in maximum level of protease. The protease profile of
the isolate shows its potential as a good source for industrial application.

1002.1569,2010-02-09,The shade avoidance syndrome: a non-markovian stochastic growth model,"  Plants at high population density compete for light, showing a series of
physiological responses known as the shade avoidance syndrome. These responses
are controlled by the synthesis of the hormone auxin, which is regulated by two
signals, an environmental one and an internal one. Considering that the auxin
signal induces plant growth after a time lag, this work shows that plant growth
can be modelled in terms of an energy-like function extremization, provided
that the Markov property is not applied. The simulated height distributions are
bimodal and right skewed, as in real community of plants. In the case of
isolated plants, the theoretical expressions for the growth dynamics and the
growth speed excellently fit experimental data for Arabidopsis thaliana.
Moreover, the growth dynamics of this model is shown to be consistent with the
biomass production function of an independent model. These results suggest that
memory effects play a non-negligible role in plant growth processes.

1002.3292,2010-05-05,Complete Human Mitochondrial Genome Construction Using L-systems,"  Recently, scientists from The Craig J. Venter Institute reported construction
of very long DNA molecules using a variety of experimental procedures adopting
a number of working hypotheses. Finding a mathematical rule for generation of
such a long sequence would revolutionize our thinking on various advanced areas
of biology, viz. evolution of long DNA chains in chromosomes, reasons for
existence of long stretches of non-coding regions as well as would usher
automated methods for long DNA chains preparation for chromosome engineering.
However, this mathematical principle must have room for editing / correcting
DNA sequences locally in those areas of genomes where mutation and / or DNA
polymerase has introduced errors over millions of years. In this paper, we
report the basics and applications of L-system (a mathematical principle) which
could answer all the aforesaid issues. At the end, we present the whole human
mitochondrial genome which has been generated using this mathematical principle
using PC computation power. We can claim now that we can make any stretch of
DNA, be it 936 bp of olfactory receptor, with or without introns, mitochondrial
DNA to 3 x 109 bp DNA sequences of the whole human genome with even a PC
computation power.

behavior of disease spreading on both static and adaptive networked systems.
This unifying approach relies on the annealed adjacency matrix, representing
one network ensemble, and allows to solve the dynamical evolution of the whole
network ensemble all at once. Our results accurately reproduce those obtained
by extensive numerical simulations showing a large improvement with respect to
the usual heterogeneous mean-field formulation. Moreover, by means of the
annealed formulation we derive a new heterogeneous mean-field formulation that
correctly reproduces the epidemic dynamics.

evolution is the software developer responsible for the existence of the

A great effort has been made to pass from wording to science, i.e., from naive
theories to robust models to predictions to testing for falsification.

1003.0836,2016-09-08,Semi-Circular Canals Anomalies//Idiopathic Scoliosis,"  Thanks to a novel modelling programme to detect anomalies in the membranous
semi circular canals (SSC) of idiopathic scoliosis (IS) we found severe
anomalies mainly located in lateral SCC devoted to trunk rotation and lateral
deviations. We also found a specific communication between the lateral and
posterior canal involving the utricular chamber which is also highly suspected
in scoliosis. Key points: - Membranous semi circular canals (SCC) modelling
based on MRI revealed significant anomalies in IS patients compared to normal
subjects. - Frequent aplasias located in the lateral canal were found in IS. -
We also discovered a, never described, abnormal communication between lateral
and posterior canal. - Lateral SCC is involved in trunk rotation and lateral
deviation: these movements are frequently abnormal in IS. Supports: Fondation

1003.0871,2013-05-29,Phase transition in a class of non-linear random networks,"  We discuss the complex dynamics of a non-linear random networks model, as a
function of the connectivity k between the elements of the network. We show
that this class of networks exhibit an order-chaos phase transition for a
critical connectivity k = 2. Also, we show that both, pairwise correlation and
complexity measures are maximized in dynamically critical networks. These
results are in good agreement with the previously reported studies on random
Boolean networks and random threshold networks, and show once again that
critical networks provide an optimal coordination of diverse behavior.

1003.1324,2015-05-18,Passive swimming in low Reynolds number flows,"  The possibility of microscopic swimming by extraction of energy from an
external flow is discussed, focusing on the migration of a simple trimer across
a linear shear flow. The geometric properties of swimming, together with the
possible generalization to the case of a vesicle, are analyzed.The mechanism of
energy extraction from the flow appears to be the generalization to a discrete
swimmer of the tank-treading regime of a vesicle. The swimmer takes advantage
of the external flow by both extracting energy for swimming and ""sailing""
through it. The migration velocity is found to scale linearly in the stroke
amplitude, and not quadratically as in a quiescent fluid. This effect turns out
to be connected with the non-applicability of the scallop theorem in the
presence of external flow fields.
"
1003.1548,2012-12-03,Fractional Chemotaxis Diffusion Equations,"  We introduce mesoscopic and macroscopic model equations of chemotaxis with
anomalous subdiffusion for modelling chemically directed transport of
biological organisms in changing chemical environments with diffusion hindered
by traps or macro-molecular crowding. The mesoscopic models are formulated
using Continuous Time Random Walk master equations and the macroscopic models
are formulated with fractional order differential equations. Different models
are proposed depending on the timing of the chemotactic forcing.
Generalizations of the models to include linear reaction dynamics are also
derived. Finally a Monte Carlo method for simulating anomalous subdiffusion
with chemotaxis is introduced and simulation results are compared with
numerical solutions of the model equations. The model equations developed here
could be used to replace Keller-Segel type equations in biological systems with
transport hindered by traps, macro-molecular crowding or other obstacles.

1003.1993,2010-03-30,A stem-cell ageing hypothesis on the origin of Parkinson's disease,"  A transcriptome-wide blood expression dataset of Parkinson's disease (PD)
patients and controls was analyzed under the hypothesis-rich mathematical
framework. The analysis pointed towards differential expression in blood cells
in many of the processes known or predicted to be disrupted in PD. We suggest
that circulating blood cells in PD patients can be in a full-blown
PD-expression state. We put forward the hypothesis that sporadic PD can
originate as a case of hematopoietic stem cell/differentiation process
expression program defect and suggest this research direction deserves further
investigation.

1003.1996,2010-07-01,"Run-and-tumble particles with hydrodynamics: sedimentation, trapping and
  upstream swimming","  We simulate by lattice Boltzmann the nonequilibrium steady states of
run-and-tumble particles (inspired by a minimal model of bacteria), interacting
by far-field hydrodynamics, subject to confinement. Under gravity, hydrodynamic
interactions barely perturb the steady state found without them, but for
particles in a harmonic trap such a state is quite changed if the run length is
larger than the confinement length: a self-assembled pump is formed. Particles
likewise confined in a narrow channel show a generic upstream flux in
Poiseuille flow: chiral swimming is not required.
"
1003.2032,2010-03-11,Active Matter,"  The term active matter describes diverse systems, spanning macroscopic (e.g.
shoals of fish and flocks of birds) to microscopic scales (e.g. migrating
cells, motile bacteria and gels formed through the interaction of nanoscale
molecular motors with cytoskeletal filaments within cells). Such systems are
often idealizable in terms of collections of individual units, referred to as
active particles or self-propelled particles, which take energy from an
internal replenishable energy depot or ambient medium and transduce it into
useful work performed on the environment, in addition to dissipating a fraction
of this energy into heat. These individual units may interact both directly as
well as through disturbances propagated via the medium in which they are
immersed. Active particles can exhibit remarkable collective behaviour as a
consequence of these interactions, including non-equilibrium phase transitions
between novel dynamical phases, large fluctuations violating expectations from
the central limit theorem and substantial robustness against the disordering
effects of thermal fluctuations. In this chapter, following a brief summary of
experimental systems which may be classified as examples of active matter, I
describe some of the principles which underlie the modeling of such systems.

1003.2120,2015-05-18,"Attractor and Basin Entropies of Random Boolean Networks Under
  Asynchronous Stochastic Update","  We introduce a numerical method to study random Boolean networks with
asynchronous stochas- tic update. Each node in the network of states starts
with equal occupation probability and this probability distribution then
evolves to a steady state. Nodes left with finite occupation probability
determine the attractors and the sizes of their basins. As for synchronous
update, the basin entropy grows with system size only for critical networks,
where the distribution of attractor lengths is a power law. We determine
analytically the distribution for the number of attractors and basin sizes for
frozen networks with connectivity K = 1.
"
1003.2600,2015-05-18,How Interactions Control Molecular Transport in Channels,"  The motion of molecules across channels is critically important for
understanding mechanisms of cellular processes. Here we investigate the
mechanism of interactions in the molecular transport by analyzing exactly
solvable discrete stochastic models. It is shown that the strength and spatial
distribution of molecule/channel interactions can strongly modify the particle
current. Our analysis indicates that the most optimal transport is achieved
when the binding sites are near the entrance or exit of the pore. In addition,
the role of intermolecular interactions is studied, and it is argued that an
increase in flux can be observed for some optimal interaction strength. The
mechanism of these phenomena is discussed.
"
1003.2628,2012-03-12,A new model for magnetoreception,"  Certain migratory birds can sense the earth's magnetic field. The nature of
this process is not yet properly understood. Here we offer a simple explanation
according to which birds literally `see' the local magnetic field: Our model
relates the well-established radical pair hypothesis to the phenomenon of
Haidinger's brush, a capacity to see the polarisation of light. This new
picture explains recent surprising experimental data indicating long lifetimes
for the radical pair. Moreover there is a clear evolutionary path toward this
field sensing mechanism: it is an enhancement of a weak effect that may be
present in many species.
"
1003.4651,2010-03-25,Equations of Motion that Recognize Biochemical Patterns,"  Equations of motion that recognize biochemical patterns are described. The
equations are partial differential equations in a continuous multiple component
system in which adequate initial and boundary conditions are given. The
biochemical patterns are spatiotemporal distributions of multiple biochemical
components that can be regarded as a continuum in concentration and mass flux.
Recognizing biochemical patterns lead to a universal property of the equations,
which is also mathematically demonstrated, that the devised equations are
sufficient to approximate any orbits in an arbitrary dynamical system, even
though that of expectedly seen in complex biological systems. This theory can
be applied to also a non-biological system that can be regarded as a continuum
comprised of any multiple components such as liquids, solids, and nonlinear
viscoelastic materials.

1003.5830,2015-05-18,"The large core limit of spiral waves in excitable media: A numerical
  approach","  We modify the freezing method introduced by Beyn & Thuemmler, 2004, for
analyzing rigidly rotating spiral waves in excitable media. The proposed method
is designed to stably determine the rotation frequency and the core radius of
rotating spirals, as well as the approximate shape of spiral waves in unbounded
domains. In particular, we introduce spiral wave boundary conditions based on
geometric approximations of spiral wave solutions by Archimedean spirals and by
involutes of circles. We further propose a simple implementation of boundary
conditions for the case when the inhibitor is non-diffusive, a case which had
previously caused spurious oscillations.
  We then utilize the method to numerically analyze the large core limit. The
proposed method allows us to investigate the case close to criticality where
spiral waves acquire infinite core radius and zero rotation frequency, before
they begin to develop into retracting fingers. We confirm the linear scaling
regime of a drift bifurcation for the rotation frequency and the core radius of
spiral wave solutions close to criticality. This regime is unattainable with
conventional numerical methods.

1004.1354,2010-04-09,On applications of Ulam-Hyers stability in biology and economics,"  We argue that Ulam-Hyers stability concept is quite significant in realistic
problems in numerical analysis, biology and economics. A generalization to
nonlinear systems is proposed and applied to the logistic equation (both
differential and difference), SIS epidemic model, Cournot model in economics
and a reaction diffusion equation. To the best of our knowledge this is the
first time Ulam-Hyers stability is considered from the applications point of
view.
"
1004.1999,2013-08-22,Towards a mathematical theory of meaningful communication,"  Despite its obvious relevance, meaning has been outside most theoretical
approaches to information in biology. As a consequence, functional responses
based on an appropriate interpretation of signals has been replaced by a
probabilistic description of correlations between emitted and received symbols.
This assumption leads to potential paradoxes, such as the presence of a maximum
information associated to a channel that would actually create completely wrong
interpretations of the signals. Game-theoretic models of language evolution use
this view of Shannon's theory, but other approaches considering embodied
communicating agents show that the correct (meaningful) match resulting from
agent-agent exchanges is always achieved and natural systems obviously solve
the problem correctly. How can Shannon's theory be expanded in such a way that
meaning -at least, in its minimal referential form- is properly incorporated?
Inspired by the concept of {\em duality of the communicative sign} stated by
the swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, here we present a complete
description of the minimal system necessary to measure the amount of
information that is consistently decoded. Several consequences of our
developments are investigated, such the uselessness of an amount of information
properly transmitted for communication among autonomous agents.
"
1004.2149,2012-02-01,Noise-induced volatility of collective dynamics,"  ""Noise-induced volatility"" refers to a phenomenon of increased level of
fluctuations in the collective dynamics of bistable units in the presence of a
rapidly varying external signal, and intermediate noise levels. The
archetypical signature of this phenomenon is that --beyond the increase in the
level of fluctuations-- the response of the system becomes uncorrelated with
the external driving force, making it different from stochastic resonance.
Numerical simulations and an analytical theory of a stochastic dynamical
version of the Ising model on regular and random networks demonstrate the
ubiquity and robustness of this phenomenon, which is argued to be a possible
cause of excess volatility in financial markets, of enhanced effective
temperatures in a variety of out-of-equilibrium systems and of strong selective
responses of immune systems of complex biological organisms. Extensive
numerical simulations are compared with a mean-field theory for different
network topologies.
"
1004.3228,2010-04-20,A heuristic view about the evolution and species,"  The controversy concerning both the definition of the species and methods for
inferring the boundaries and numbers of species has occupied biologists for
centuries, and the debate itself has become known as the species problem. The
modern theory of evolution depends on a fundamental redefinition of ""species"".
Here we show that based on the model of evolutionary continuum combined with
fuzzy theory that the evolution system is a uncountable infinite set and
species is a fuzzy set, the contradiction between discrete biological entities
and continuous evolution system is solved, i.e. when a species evolved, the
individuals scattered in space but continuously distributed on time sequences.
Moreover, the calculation methods for species are suggested both in theory and
practice.
"
1004.4179,2015-05-18,Effective swimming strategies in low Reynolds number flows,"  The optimal strategy for a microscopic swimmer to migrate across a linear
shear flow is discussed. The two cases, in which the swimmer is located at
large distance, and in the proximity of a solid wall, are taken into account.
It is shown that migration can be achieved by means of a combination of sailing
through the flow and swimming, where the swimming strokes are induced by the
external flow without need of internal energy sources or external drives. The
structural dynamics required for the swimmer to move in the desired direction
is discussed and two simple models, based respectively on the presence of an
elastic structure, and on an orientation dependent friction, to control the
deformations induced by the external flow, are analyzed. In all cases, the
deformation sequence is a generalization of the tank-treading motion regimes
observed in vesicles in shear flows. Analytic expressions for the migration
velocity as a function of the deformation pattern and amplitude are provided.
The effects of thermal fluctuations on propulsion have been discussed and the
possibility that noise be exploited to overcome the limitations imposed on the
microswimmer by the scallop theorem have been discussed.
"
1004.4186,2012-04-09,A 2-dimensional Geometry for Biological Time,"  This paper proposes an abstract mathematical frame for describing some
features of biological time. The key point is that usual physical (linear)
representation of time is insufficient, in our view, for the understanding key
phenomena of life, such as rhythms, both physical (circadian, seasonal ...) and
properly biological (heart beating, respiration, metabolic ...). In particular,
the role of biological rhythms do not seem to have any counterpart in
mathematical formalization of physical clocks, which are based on frequencies
along the usual (possibly thermodynamical, thus oriented) time. We then suggest
a functional representation of biological time by a 2-dimensional manifold as a
mathematical frame for accommodating autonomous biological rhythms. The
""visual"" representation of rhythms so obtained, in particular heart beatings,
will provide, by a few examples, hints towards possible applications of our
approach to the understanding of interspecific differences or intraspecific
pathologies. The 3-dimensional embedding space, needed for purely mathematical
reasons, allows to introduce a suitable extra-dimension for ""representation
time"", with a cognitive significance.
"
1004.4792,2011-07-26,Social Network Sensors for Early Detection of Contagious Outbreaks,"  Current methods for the detection of contagious outbreaks give
contemporaneous information about the course of an epidemic at best.
Individuals at the center of a social network are likely to be infected sooner,
on average, than those at the periphery. However, mapping a whole network to
identify central individuals whom to monitor is typically very difficult. We
propose an alternative strategy that does not require ascertainment of global
network structure, namely, monitoring the friends of randomly selected
individuals. Such individuals are known to be more central. To evaluate whether
such a friend group could indeed provide early detection, we studied a flu
outbreak at Harvard College in late 2009. We followed 744 students divided
between a random group and a friend group. Based on clinical diagnoses, the
progression of the epidemic in the friend group occurred 14.7 days (95% C.I.
11.7-17.6) in advance of the randomly chosen group (i.e., the population as a
whole). The friend group also showed a significant lead time (p<0.05) on day 16
of the epidemic, a full 46 days before the peak in daily incidence in the
population as a whole. This sensor method could provide significant additional
time to react to epidemics in small or large populations under surveillance.
Moreover, the method could in principle be generalized to other biological,
psychological, informational, or behavioral contagions that spread in networks.
"
1004.5361,2012-04-09,Protention and retention in biological systems,"  This paper proposes an abstract mathematical frame for describing some
features of cognitive and biological time. We focus here on the so called
""extended present"" as a result of protentional and retentional activities
(memory and anticipation). Memory, as retention, is treated in some physical
theories (relaxation phenomena, which will inspire our approach), while
protention (or anticipation) seems outside the scope of physics. We then
suggest a simple functional representation of biological protention. This
allows us to introduce the abstract notion of ""biological inertia"".
"
1005.0228,2010-05-04,"Anxiety as a Factor in the Development of Autistic Spectrum Symptoms: an
  Experimental Study","  It is well known that psychoemotional disorders may be accompanied by
decreased sociability in humans. It has been shown that repeated social defeats
in 10 daily agonistic interactions in male mice led to development of the
expressed level of anxiety and to reduction of communication estimated in the
elevated plus-maze and partition tests, respectively. In the social
interactions test, sociable behavior toward unfamiliar partner and exploratory
activity were dramatically decreased in defeated male mice. Avoidance of
approaching partner was significantly increased. Demonstration of self-grooming
behavior was increased in defeated males. Chronic diazepam treatment (0.5
mg/kg, i.p., 2 weeks) led to significant decrease of anxiety level estimated in
the elevated plus maze test and to improvement of communication in the
partition test. In the social interaction test diazepam completely restored the
level of sociability and exploratory activity and reduced avoidance behavior of
approaching partner. Diazepam did not affect self-grooming demonstration. It is
concluded that main factor which provokes decrease in communication in defeated
male mice is the high level of anxiety. Similarity between changes in social
behavior in defeated mice and symptoms of autism in humans is discussed. It is
supposed that this behavioral approach may be useful for studying the molecular
mechanisms of autistic spectrum disorders, developing under chronic negative
social experiences.

1005.0753,2010-05-07,"Mobilisation readiness state and the frequency structure of heart rate
  variability","  A number of studies showed association of mental status with heart rate
variability. This work discovered a feature of frequency structure of heart
rate variability that is associated with mental readiness. In three independent
groups of 64, 39, and 19 volunteers by the factor analysis of heart rate
periodograms, it has been discovered that there are at least two other heart
rate oscillation phenomena apart from the well known low frequency oscillations
and respiratory arrhythmia. They have periods of 3 and 4 heart beats.
Association of amplitude of 3-beats oscillation with level of mental readiness
was shown due to further observation in two independent groups of 12 and 7.
Moreover, possibility of assessment of mental readiness by the mathematical
model based on heart rate periodogram was suggested.
"
1005.5101,2010-05-28,"Matrix genetics, part 5: genetic projection operators and direct sums","  The article is devoted to phenomena of symmetries and algebras in matrix
presentations of the genetic code. The Kronecker family of the genetic matrices
is investigated, which is based on the alphabetical matrix [C A; U G], where C,
A, U, G are the letters of the genetic alphabet. The matrix P=[C A; U G] in the
third Kronecker power is the (8*8)-matrix, which contains 64 triplets.
Peculiarities of the degeneracy of the genetic code are reflected in the
symmetrical black-and-white mosaic of this genetic (8*8)-matrix of 64 triplets.
Phenomena of connections of this mosaic matrix (and many other genetic
matrices) with projection operators are revealed. Taking into account an
important role of projection operators in quantum mechanics, theory of digital
codes, computer science, logic and in many other fields of applied mathematics,
we study algebraic properties and biological meanings of these phenomena. Using
of notions and formalisms of theory of finite-dimensional vector spaces in
bioinformatics and theoretical biology is proposed on the bases of the
described results.

1006.1260,2011-01-06,What's in a crowd? Analysis of face-to-face behavioral networks,"  The availability of new data sources on human mobility is opening new avenues
for investigating the interplay of social networks, human mobility and
dynamical processes such as epidemic spreading. Here we analyze data on the
time-resolved face-to-face proximity of individuals in large-scale real-world
scenarios. We compare two settings with very different properties, a scientific
conference and a long-running museum exhibition. We track the behavioral
networks of face-to-face proximity, and characterize them from both a static
and a dynamic point of view, exposing important differences as well as striking
similarities. We use our data to investigate the dynamics of a
susceptible-infected model for epidemic spreading that unfolds on the dynamical
networks of human proximity. The spreading patterns are markedly different for
the conference and the museum case, and they are strongly impacted by the
causal structure of the network data. A deeper study of the spreading paths
shows that the mere knowledge of static aggregated networks would lead to
erroneous conclusions about the transmission paths on the dynamical networks.

1006.1585,2015-05-19,"Microbial Fuel Cells Applied to the Metabolically-Based Detection of
  Extraterrestrial Life","  Since the 1970's, when the Viking spacecrafts carried out experiments aimed
to the detection of microbial metabolism on the surface of Mars, the search for
nonspecific methods to detect life in situ has been one of the goals of
astrobiology. It is usually required that the methodology can detect life
independently from its composition or form, and that the chosen biological
signature points to a feature common to all living systems, as the presence of
metabolism. In this paper we evaluate the use of Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs)
for the detection of microbial life in situ. MFCs are electrochemical devices
originally developed as power electrical sources, and can be described as fuel
cells in which the anode is submerged in a medium that contains microorganisms.
These microorganisms, as part of their metabolic process, oxidize organic
material releasing electrons that contribute to the electric current, which is
therefore proportional to metabolic and other redox processes. We show that
power and current density values measured in MFCs using microorganism cultures
or soil samples in the anode are much larger than those obtained using a medium
free of microorganisms or sterilized soil samples, respectively. In particular,
we found that this is true for extremophiles, usually proposed to live in
extraterrestrial environments. Therefore, our results show that MFCs have the
potential to be used to detect microbial life in situ.
"
1006.5505,2010-06-30,"Triadic Conceptual Structure of the Maximum Entropy Approach to
  Evolution","  Many problems in evolutionary theory are cast in dyadic terms, such as the
polar oppositions of organism and environment. We argue that a triadic
conceptual structure offers an alternative perspective under which the
information generating role of evolution as a physical process can be analyzed,
and propose a new diagrammatic approach. Peirce's natural philosophy was deeply
influenced by his reception of both Darwin's theory and thermodynamics. Thus,
we elaborate on a new synthesis which puts together his theory of signs and
modern Maximum Entropy approaches to evolution. Following recent contributions
to the naturalization of Peircean semiosis, we show that triadic structures
involve the conjunction of three different kinds of causality, efficient,
formal and final. We apply this on Ulanowicz's analysis of autocatalytic cycles
as primordial patterns of life. This paves the way for a semiotic view of
thermodynamics which is built on the idea that Peircean interpretants are
systems of physical inference devices evolving under natural selection. In this
view, the principles of Maximum Entropy, Maximum Power, and Maximum Entropy
Production work together to drive the emergence of information carrying
structures, which at the same time maximize information capacity as well as the
gradients of energy flows, such that ultimately, contrary to Schroedinger's
seminal contribution, the evolutionary process is seen to be a physical
expression of the Second Law.

1007.3680,2010-07-22,"Dynamics of person-to-person interactions from distributed RFID sensor
  networks","  Digital networks, mobile devices, and the possibility of mining the
ever-increasing amount of digital traces that we leave behind in our daily
activities are changing the way we can approach the study of human and social
interactions. Large-scale datasets, however, are mostly available for
collective and statistical behaviors, at coarse granularities, while
high-resolution data on person-to-person interactions are generally limited to
relatively small groups of individuals. Here we present a scalable experimental
framework for gathering real-time data resolving face-to-face social
interactions with tunable spatial and temporal granularities. We use active
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices that assess mutual proximity in a
distributed fashion by exchanging low-power radio packets. We analyze the
dynamics of person-to-person interaction networks obtained in three
high-resolution experiments carried out at different orders of magnitude in
community size. The data sets exhibit common statistical properties and lack of
a characteristic time scale from 20 seconds to several hours. The association
between the number of connections and their duration shows an interesting
super-linear behavior, which indicates the possibility of defining
super-connectors both in the number and intensity of connections. Taking
advantage of scalability and resolution, this experimental framework allows the
monitoring of social interactions, uncovering similarities in the way
individuals interact in different contexts, and identifying patterns of
super-connector behavior in the community. These results could impact our
understanding of all phenomena driven by face-to-face interactions, such as the
spreading of transmissible infectious diseases and information.

1007.4523,2010-07-27,"A Hybrid Model for Disease Spread and an Application to the SARS
  Pandemic","  Pandemics can cause immense disruption and damage to communities and
societies. Thus far, modeling of pandemics has focused on either large-scale
difference equation models like the SIR and the SEIR models, or detailed
micro-level simulations, which are harder to apply at a global scale. This
paper introduces a hybrid model for pandemics considering both global and local
spread of infections. We hypothesize that the spread of an infectious disease
between regions is significantly influenced by global traffic patterns and the
spread within a region is influenced by local conditions. Thus we model the
spread of pandemics considering the connections between regions for the global
spread of infection and population density based on the SEIR model for the
local spread of infection. We validate our hybrid model by carrying out a
simulation study for the spread of SARS pandemic of 2002-2003 using available
data on population, population density, and traffic networks between different
regions. While it is well-known that international relationships and global
traffic patterns significantly influence the spread of pandemics, our results
show that integrating these factors into relatively simple models can greatly
improve the results of modeling disease spread.

1007.4529,2015-05-19,"Amino Acids in Comets and Meteorites: Stability under Gamma Radiation
  and Preservation of Chirality","  Amino acids in solar system bodies may have played a key role in the
chemistry that led to the origin of life on Earth. We present laboratory
studies testing the stability of amino acids against gamma radiation
photolysis. All the 20 chiral amino acids in the levo form used in the proteins
of the current terrestrial biochemistry have been irradiated in the solid state
with gamma radiation to a dose of 3.2 MGy which is the dose equivalent to that
derived by radionuclide decay in comets and asteroids in 1.05x109 years. For
each amino acid the radiolysis degree and the radioracemization degree was
measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and by optical rotatory
dispersion (ORD) spectroscopy. From these measurements a radiolysis rate
constant kdsc and a radioracemization rate constant krac have been determined
for each amino acid and extrapolated to a dose of 14 MGy which corresponds to
the expected total dose delivered by the natural radionuclides decay to all the
organic molecules present in comets and asteroids in 4.6x109 years, the age of
the Solar System. It is shown that all the amino acids studied can survive a
radiation dose of 14 MGy in significant quantity although part of them are lost
in radiolytic processes. Similarly, also the radioracemization process
accompanying the radiolysis does not extinguish the chirality. The knowledge of
the radiolysis and radioracemization rate constants may permit the calculation
of the original concentration of the amino acids at the times of the formation
of the Solar System starting from the concentration found today in carbonaceous
chondrites. For some amino acids the concentration in the presolar nebula could
have been up to 6 times higher than currently observed in meteorites.

these two processes causing a change in the optically detected signal. A model
is developed for describing such systems in an approach suitable for evaluation
of the analog noise amplification properties of the gate and optimization of

geological process. We provide a thermodynamic framework in which to assess how
life emerged at the off-axis hydrothermal vent system; the RNA - clays system
has been investigated from the entropic point of view, showing that the
stabilization of the system in a state further away from equilibrium state, by
an inorganic heterogeneous compartmetalization phenomena, is able to produce

1008.2362,2010-08-16,'Genesis': A takeover from field-responsive matter?,"  Cairns-Smith (2008) has argued for a pre-Darwinian era, with a simpler basis
for life's functioning via primitive ""crystal genes"" (information transfer,
kinetic control on metabolic reactions). At the other extreme, guided by the
structural similarity of clusters in early-evolved enzymes to iron-sulphide
minerals like greigite, the hydrothermal mound scenario of Russell and
coworkers (1994) presents how non-equilibrium forces rooted in geochemistry
could be extrapolated to understand the metabolic functioning of living
systems. The informational vs metabolic aspects of life in these respective
scenarios can be linked together via a framboid-based theory of Sawlowicz
(2000), as these assemblies typically form in colloidal environments. In this
background, we consider the ramifications of a magnetic rock field on the mound
scenario, asking if soft matter assemblies are compatible with a coherent
order.
"
1008.3695,2010-08-24,The Entropy of Morbidity Trauma and Mortality,"  In this paper it is shown that statistical mechanics in the form of
thermodynamic entropy can be used as a measure of the severity of individual
injuries (AIS), and that the correct way to account for multiple injuries is to
sum the entropies. It is further shown that summing entropies according to the
Planck-Boltzmann (P-B) definition of entropy is formally the same as ISS, which
is why ISS works. Approximate values of the probabilities of fatality are used
to calculate the Gibb's entropy, which is more accurate than the P-B entropy
far from equilibrium, and are shown to be again proportional to ISS. For the
categorisation of injury using entropies it is necessary to consider the
underlying entropy of the individuals morbidity to which is added the entropy
of trauma, which then may result in death. Adding in the underlying entropy and
summing entropies of all AIS3+ values gives a more extended scale than ISS, and
so entropy is considered the preferred measure. A small scale trial is
conducted of these concepts using the APROSYS In-Depth Pedestrian database, and
the differences between the measures are illustrated. It is shown that adopting
an entropy approach to categorising injury severity highlights the position of
the elderly, who have a reduced physiological reserve to resist further
traumatic onslaught. There are other informational entropy-like measures, here
called i-entropy, which can also be used to classify injury severity, which are
outlined. A large scale trial of these various entropy or i-entropy measures
needs to be conducted to assess the usefulness of the measures. In the

1009.0310,2010-09-03,"Synthesis of Sugar and fixation of CO2 through Artificial Photosynthesis
  driving by Hydrogen or Electricity","  The overall process of photosynthesis consists of two main phases, the
so-called light and dark eactions: light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll
molecules and transferred to regenerate NADH and ATP, then drive Calvin-Benson
cycle to synthesize sugar. In order to synthesize sugar through artificial
photosynthesis, one of the key is to regenerate ATP economically and improve
the efficiency of dark reactions. Here 9 kinds of dark reaction pathways are
proposed, which only NADH is regenearated from hydrogen or electricity for
driving, the efficiency of dark reactions is improved, combined with solar
photovoltaic or solar hydrogen technology, the total efficiency of artificial
photosynthesis can reach 30%, several ten times more than natural
photosynthesis. One of them, to use chemical synthesis of formaldehyde from CO2
and H2, no NADH and ATP is need, to synthesize sugar efficiently through 9
enzymes, so it will be easier to produce in large scale, and the sugar will be
a good energy carrier as the sugar can be efficiently converted to energy
carrier hydrogen through enzymes.

1009.3224,2015-06-16,Diagonalizing the genome I: navigation in tree spaces,"  The orientable cover of the moduli space of real genus zero algebraic curves
with marked points is a compact aspherical manifold tiled by associahedra,
which resolves the singularities of the space of phylogenetic trees. The
resolution maps planar metric trees to their underlying abstract
representatives, collapsing and folding an explicit geometric decomposition of
the moduli space into cubes. This decomposition endows the resolving space with
an interesting canonical pseudometric.
  The second part of this paper defines a related (stacky) resolution of a
space of real quadratic forms, and suggests, perhaps without much
justification, that systems of oscillators parametrized by such objects may
provide useful models in genomics.

1010.0575,2010-10-05,Motion Parallax is Asymptotic to Binocular Disparity,"  Researchers especially beginning with (Rogers & Graham, 1982) have noticed
important psychophysical and experimental similarities between the
neurologically different motion parallax and stereopsis cues. Their
quantitative analysis relied primarily on the ""disparity equivalence""
approximation. In this article we show that retinal motion from lateral
translation satisfies a strong (""asymptotic"") approximation to binocular
disparity. This precise mathematical similarity is also practical in the sense
that it applies at normal viewing distances. The approximation is an extension
to peripheral vision of (Cormac & Fox's 1985) well-known non-trig central
vision approximation for binocular disparity. We hope our simple algebraic
formula will be useful in analyzing experiments outside central vision where
less precise approximations have led to a number of quantitative errors in the
vision literature.

1010.4726,2010-10-25,"Information Maximization Fails to Maximize Expected Utility in a Simple
  Foraging Model","  Information theory has explained the organization of many biological
phenomena, from the physiology of sensory receptive fields to the variability
of certain DNA sequence ensembles. Some scholars have proposed that information
should provide the central explanatory principle in biology, in the sense that
any behavioral strategy that is optimal for an organism's survival must
necessarily involve efficient information processing. We challenge this view by
providing a counterexample. We present an analytically tractable model for a
particular instance of a perception-action loop: a creature searching for a
food source confined to a one-dimensional ring world. The model incorporates
the statistical structure of the creature's world, the effects of the
creature's actions on that structure, and the creature's strategic decision
process. The model takes the form of a Markov process on an infinite
dimensional state space. To analyze it we construct an exact coarse graining
that reduces the model to a Markov process on a finite number of ""information
states"". This technique allows us to make quantitative comparisons between the
performance of an information-theoretically optimal strategy with other
candidate strategies on a food gathering task. We find that: 1. Information
optimal search does not necessarily optimize utility (expected food gain). 2.
The rank ordering of search strategies by information performance does not
predict their ordering by expected food obtained. 3. The relative advantage of
different strategies depends on the statistical structure of the environment,
in particular the variability of motion of the source. We conclude that there
is no simple relationship between information and utility. Behavioral
optimality does not imply information efficiency, nor is there a simple
tradeoff between gaining information about a food source versus obtaining the
food itself.

1010.5178,2015-05-20,There's plenty of time for evolution,"  Objections to Darwinian evolution are often based on the time required to
carry out the necessary mutations. Seemingly, exponential numbers of mutations
are needed. We show that such estimates ignore the effects of natural
selection, and that the numbers of necessary mutations are thereby reduced to
about $K\log{L}$, rather than $K^L$, where $L$ is the length of the genomic
""word"", and $K$ is the number of possible ""letters"" that can occupy any
position in the word. The required theory makes contact with the theory of
radix-exchange sorting in theoretical computer science, and the asymptotic
analysis of certain sums that occur there.

1010.5394,2010-10-27,Hierarchical group dynamics in pigeon flocks,"  Animals that travel together in groups display a variety of fascinating
motion patterns thought to be the result of delicate local interactions among
group members. Although the most informative way of investigating and
interpreting collective movement phenomena would be afforded by the collection
of high-resolution spatiotemporal data from moving individuals, such data are
scarce and are virtually non-existent for long-distance group motion within a
natural setting because of the associated technological difficulties. Here we
present results of experiments in which track logs of homing pigeons flying in
flocks of up to 10 individuals have been obtained by high-resolution
lightweight GPS devices and analyzed using a variety of correlation functions
inspired by approaches common in statistical physics. We find a well-defined
hierarchy among flock members from data concerning leading roles in pairwise
interactions, defined on the basis of characteristic delay times between birds'
directional choices. The average spatial position of a pigeon within the flock
strongly correlates with its place in the hierarchy, and birds respond more
quickly to conspecifics perceived primarily through the left eye - both results
revealing differential roles for birds that assume different positions with
respect to flock-mates. From an evolutionary perspective, our results suggest
that hierarchical organisation of group flight may be more efficient than an
egalitarian one, at least for those flock sizes that permit regular pairwise
interactions among group members, during which leader-follower relationships
are consistently manifested.

1011.0466,2015-03-17,Fluctuation-driven Turing patterns,"  Models of diffusion driven pattern formation that rely on the Turing
mechanism are utilized in many areas of science. However, many such models
suffer from the defect of requiring fine tuning of parameters or an unrealistic
separation of scales in the diffusivities of the constituents of the system in
order to predict the formation of spatial patterns. In the context of a very
generic model of ecological pattern formation, we show that the inclusion of
intrinsic noise in Turing models leads to the formation of ""quasi-patterns""
that form in generic regions of parameter space and are experimentally
distinguishable from standard Turing patterns. The existence of quasi-patterns
removes the need for unphysical fine tuning or separation of scales in the
application of Turing models to real systems.

1012.0434,2010-12-03,Thermal soaring flight of birds and unmanned aerial vehicles,"  Thermal soaring saves much energy, but flying large distances in this form
represents a great challenge for birds, people and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs). The solution is to make use of so-called thermals, which are localized,
warmer regions in the atmosphere moving upwards with a speed exceeding the
descent rate of birds and planes. Saving energy by exploiting the environment
more efficiently is an important possibility for autonomous UAVs as well.
Successful control strategies have been developed recently for UAVs in
simulations and in real applications. This paper first presents an overview of
our knowledge of the soaring flight and strategy of birds, followed by a
discussion of control strategies that have been developed for soaring UAVs both
in simulations and applications on real platforms. To improve the accuracy of
simulation of thermal exploitation strategies we propose a method to take into
account the effect of turbulence. Finally we propose a new GPS independent
control strategy for exploiting thermal updraft.

1012.1684,2015-03-17,"A Network-Based Meta-Population Approach to Model Rift Valley Fever
  Epidemics","  Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) has been expanding its geographical
distribution with important implications for both human and animal health. The
emergence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the Middle East, and its continuing
presence in many areas of Africa, has negatively impacted both medical and
veterinary infrastructures and human health. Furthermore, worldwide attention
should be directed towards the broader infection dynamics of RVFV. We propose a
new compartmentalized model of RVF and the related ordinary differential
equations to assess disease spread in both time and space; with the latter
driven as a function of contact networks. The model is based on weighted
contact networks, where nodes of the networks represent geographical regions
and the weights represent the level of contact between regional pairings for
each set of species. The inclusion of human, animal, and vector movements among
regions is new to RVF modeling. The movement of the infected individuals is not
only treated as a possibility, but also an actuality that can be incorporated
into the model. We have tested, calibrated, and evaluated the model using data
from the recent 2010 RVF outbreak in South Africa as a case study; mapping the
epidemic spread within and among three South African provinces. An extensive
set of simulation results shows the potential of the proposed approach for
accurately modeling the RVF spreading process in additional regions of the
world. The benefits of the proposed model are twofold: not only can the model
differentiate the maximum number of infected individuals among different
provinces, but also it can reproduce the different starting times of the
outbreak in multiple locations. Finally, the exact value of the reproduction
number is numerically computed and upper and lower bounds for the reproduction
number are analytically derived in the case of homogeneous populations.

  definition of life","  It is high time to openly and without finalism define the dangerous but
needed term 'purposeful information', whose quantity is an Eigen information
value. Using the term 'biological information' in its stead forces one into an
uncomfortable detour. I propose such a definition based on the generalized
notions of 'information' and 'encoding'. Next, the properties of the
spontaneous process of collecting purposeful information are investigated. In
effect, the properties of this process: the goal 'continuation of existence',
reproduction and Darwinian mechanism are derived which suggest, that it is the
natural life process. A 'natural identity criterion' appears in this process
for an evolving object, that is connected to a 'small change tendency'.
Likewise, 'hereditary information' is defined. Artificial life is constructed
by living objects, is a part of natural life process and its properties are not
an effect of its internal restrictions but of external assumptions.

  suggests a role in memory affirmation pathways. Overexposure to epinephrine
  inactivates adenylate-cyclase,a causal pathway for stress-pathologies","  Incubation with noradrenaline (norepinephrine) of isolated membranes of rat's
brain corpus striatum and cortex, showed that ionic-magnesium (Mg2+) is
required for the neurotransmitter activatory response of Adenylate Cyclase [ATP
pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), (EC 4.6.1.1)], AC.An Mg2+-dependent response
to the activatory effects of adrenaline, and subsequent inhibition by calcium,
suggest capability for a turnover, associated with cyclic changes in membrane
potential and participation in a short term-memory pathway.In the cell, the
neurotransmitter by activating AC generates intracellular cyclic AMP. Calcium
entrance in the cell inhibits the enzyme. The increment of cyclic AMP activates
kinaseA and their protein phosphorylating activity, allowing a long term memory
pathway. Hence, consolidating neuronal circuits, related to emotional learning
and memory affirmation.The activatory effect relates to an enzyme-noradrenaline
complex which may participate on the physiology of the fight or flight
response, by prolonged exposure. However, the persistence of an unstable enzyme
complex turns the enzyme inactive. Effect concordant, with the observation that
prolonged exposure to adrenaline, participate in the etiology of stress
triggered pathologies. At the cell physiological level AC responsiveness to
hormones could be modulated by the concentration of Chelating Metabolites.
These ones produce the release of free ATP4-, a negative modulator of AC and
the Mg2+ activated insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (IRTK). Thus, allowing an
integration of the hormonal response of both enzymes by ionic controls. This
effect could supersede the metabolic feedback control by energy-charge.
Accordingly, maximum hormonal response of both enzymes, to high Mg2+ and low
free ATP4-, allows a correlation with the known effects of low caloric intake
increasing average life expectancy.

interoperability and connectivity concerns, high performance computing
limitations, and the development of customized computational frameworks and
flexible workflows to efficiently exploit shared resources without causing
impediments to the user. Outreach programs include training workshops and
classes for high school teachers and students and the new Adopt-a-Gene

1012.4189,2010-12-21,BioLogistics and the Struggle for Efficiency: Concepts and Perspectives,"  The growth of world population, limitation of resources, economic problems
and environmental issues force engineers to develop increasingly efficient
solutions for logistic systems. Pure optimization for efficiency, however, has
often led to technical solutions that are vulnerable to variations in supply
and demand, and to perturbations. In contrast, nature already provides a large
variety of efficient, flexible and robust logistic solutions. Can we utilize
biological principles to design systems, which can flexibly adapt to hardly
predictable, fluctuating conditions? We propose a bio-inspired ""BioLogistics""
approach to deduce dynamic organization processes and principles of adaptive
self-control from biological systems, and to transfer them to man-made
logistics (including nanologistics), using principles of modularity,
self-assembly, self-organization, and decentralized coordination. Conversely,
logistic models can help revealing the logic of biological processes at the
systems level.

but the encoded proteome is not being explored to its fullest. Our bibliometric
analysis of several large protein families, including those known to be
""druggable"", reveals that, even today, most papers focus on proteins that were
known prior to 2000. It is evident that one or more aspects of the biomedical

to their functional relevance. It is perhaps not surprising that relatively few

1102.0966,2015-08-17,Brownian walkers within subdiffusing territorial boundaries,"  Inspired by the collective phenomenon of territorial emergence, whereby
animals move and interact through the scent marks they deposit, we study the
dynamics of a 1D Brownian walker in a random environment consisting of
confining boundaries that are themselves diffusing anomalously. We show how to
reduce, in certain parameter regimes, the non-Markovian, many-body problem of
territoriality to the analytically tractable one-body problem studied here. The
mean square displacement (MSD) of the 1D Brownian walker within subdiffusing
boundaries is calculated exactly and generalizes well known results when the
boundaries are immobile. Furthermore, under certain conditions, if the boundary
dynamics are strongly subdiffusive, we show the appearance of an interesting
non-monotonicity in the time dependence of the MSD, giving rise to transient
negative diffusion.

1102.1027,2015-03-18,"Collective Classification of Textual Documents by Guided
  Self-Organization in T-Cell Cross-Regulation Dynamics","  We present and study an agent-based model of T-Cell cross-regulation in the
adaptive immune system, which we apply to binary classification. Our method
expands an existing analytical model of T-cell cross-regulation (Carneiro et
al. in Immunol Rev 216(1):48-68, 2007) that was used to study the
self-organizing dynamics of a single population of T-Cells in interaction with
an idealized antigen presenting cell capable of presenting a single antigen.
With agent-based modeling we are able to study the self-organizing dynamics of
multiple populations of distinct T-cells which interact via antigen presenting
cells that present hundreds of distinct antigens. Moreover, we show that such
self-organizing dynamics can be guided to produce an effective binary
classification of antigens, which is competitive with existing machine learning
methods when applied to biomedical text classification. More specifically, here
we test our model on a dataset of publicly available full-text biomedical
articles provided by the BioCreative challenge (Krallinger in The biocreative
ii. 5 challenge overview, p 19, 2009). We study the robustness of our model's
parameter configurations, and show that it leads to encouraging results
comparable to state-of-the-art classifiers. Our results help us understand both
T-cell cross-regulation as a general principle of guided self-organization, as
well as its applicability to document classification. Therefore, we show that
our bio-inspired algorithm is a promising novel method for biomedical article
classification and for binary document classification in general.

molecular-genetic alphabets have revealed algebraic properties of this system.
Families of genetic (4*4)- and (8*8)-matrices show unexpected connections of
the genetic system with Walsh functions and Hadamard matrices, which are known
in theory of noise-immunity coding, digital communication and digital
holography. Dyadic-shift decompositions of such genetic matrices lead to sets
of sparse matrices. Each of these sets is closed in relation to multiplication
and defines relevant algebra of hypercomplex numbers. It is shown that genetic
Hadamard matrices are identical to matrix representations of Hamilton
quaternions and its complexification in the case of unit coordinates. The
diversity of known dialects of the genetic code is analyzed from the viewpoint
of the genetic algebras. An algebraic analogy with Punnett squares for
inherited traits is shown. Our results are used in analyzing genetic phenomena.
The statement about existence of the geno-logic code in DNA and epigenetics on
the base of the spectral logic of systems of Boolean functions is put forward.
Our results show promising ways to develop algebraic-logical biology, in
particular, in connection with the logic holography on Walsh functions.

1102.4623,2012-08-28,"Length, Weight, and Yield in Channel Catfish, Lake Diane, MI","  Background: Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) are important to both
commercial aquaculture and recreational fisheries. Little published data is
available on length-weight relationships of channel catfish in Michigan. Though
there is no record of public or private stocking, channel catfish appeared in
Lake Diane between 1984 and 1995 and it has developed into an excellent
fishery. Results: NLLS regression yields parameter estimates of b = 3.2293 and
a = 0.00522. The improved model yields the same estimate for the exponent, b,
and a length estimate (parameter L1) of 45.23 cm. Estimates of uncertainty and
covariance are smaller for the improved model, but the correlation coefficient
is r = 0.995 in both cases. LLS regression produced different parameter values,
a = 0.01356 and b = 2.9726, and a smaller correlation coefficient, r = 0.980.
On average, catfish in the sample weighed 106.0% of the standard weight, (Brown
et al.) and the linear regression (no slope) of fillet yield vs. total weight
suggests a typical fillet yield of 28.1% with r = 0.989. Conclusion: Most of
the fish in the sample were above the standard weight, heavier than the 75th
percentile for their length. Channel catfish are doing well in Lake Diane and
the population is well matched to the food supply. Management should attempt to
maintain current population levels. In this case, the improved length-weight
model, W(L) = (L/L1)^b, provided lower uncertainties in parameter estimates and
smaller covariance than the traditional model.

1103.1833,2012-04-09,From Physics to Biology by Extending Criticality and Symmetry Breakings,"  Symmetries play a major role in physics, in particular since the work by E.
Noether and H. Weyl in the first half of last century. Herein, we briefly
review their role by recalling how symmetry changes allow to conceptually move
from classical to relativistic and quantum physics. We then introduce our
ongoing theoretical analysis in biology and show that symmetries play a
radically different role in this discipline, when compared to those in current
physics. By this comparison, we stress that symmetries must be understood in
relation to conservation and stability properties, as represented in the
theories. We posit that the dynamics of biological organisms, in their various
levels of organization, are not ""just"" processes, but permanent (extended, in
our terminology) critical transitions and, thus, symmetry changes. Within the
limits of a relative structural stability (or interval of viability),
variability is at the core of these transitions.

progress is underway, developing a vaccine against the disease is challenging.
Thus, the main approach to fight the disease is vector control. A model for the
transmission of Dengue disease is presented. It consists of eight mutually
exclusive compartments representing the human and vector dynamics. It also
includes a control parameter (insecticide) in order to fight the mosquito. The
model presents three possible equilibria: two disease-free equilibria (DFE) and
another endemic equilibrium. It has been proved that a DFE is locally
asymptotically stable, whenever a certain epidemiological threshold, known as
the basic reproduction number, is less than one. We show that if we apply a
minimum level of insecticide, it is possible to maintain the basic reproduction
number below unity. A case study, using data of the outbreak that occurred in
2009 in Cape Verde, is presented.

1104.0174,2011-04-04,"Anthropogenic Renourishment Feedback on Shorebirds: a Multispecies
  Bayesian Perspective","  In this paper the realized niche of the Snowy Plover (Charadrius
alexandrinus), a primarily resident Florida shorebird, is described as a
function of the scenopoetic and bionomic variables at the nest-, landscape-,
and regional-scale. We identified some pos- sible geomorphological controls
that influence nest-site selection and survival using data collected along the
Florida Gulf coast. In particular we focused on the effects of beach
replenishment interventions on the Snowy Plover (SP), and on the migratory
Piping Plover (PP) (Charadrius melodus) and Red Knot (RK) (Calidris canutus).
To quantify the relationship between past renourishment projects and shorebird
species we used a Monte Carlo procedure to sample from the posterior
distribution of the binomial probabilities that a region is not a nesting or a
wintering ground conditional on the occurrence of a beach replenishment
intervention in the same and the previous year. The results indicate that it
was 2.3, 3.1, and 0.8 times more likely that a region was not a wintering
ground following a year with a renourishment intervention for the SP, PP and RK
respectively. For the SP it was 2.5. times more likely that a region was not a
breeding ground after a renourishment event. Through a maximum entropy
principle model we observed small differences in the habitat use of the SP
during the breeding and the wintering season. However the habitats where RK was
observed ap- peared quite different. Maintaining and creating optimal suitable
habitats for SP characterized by sparse low vegetation in the foredunes areas,
and uneven/low-slope beach surfaces, is the proposed conservation scenario to
convert anthropic beach restorations and SP populations into a positive
feedback without impacting other threatened shorebird species.
"
1104.1110,2011-04-07,Randomness and Multi-level Interactions in Biology,"  The dynamic instability of the living systems and the ""superposition"" of
different forms of randomness are viewed as a component of the contingently
increasing organization of life along evolution. We briefly survey how
classical and quantum physics define randomness differently. We then discuss
why this requires, in our view, an enrichment of the understanding of the
effects of their concurrent presence in biological systems' dynamics.
Biological randomness is then presented as an essential component of the
heterogeneous determination and intrinsic unpredictability proper to life
phenomena, due to the nesting and interaction of many levels of organization.
Even increasing organization itself induces growing disorder, by energy
dispersal effects of course, but also by variability and differentiation.
Co-operation between diverse components in networks implies at the same time
the presence of constraints due to the peculiar forms of (bio-)resonance and

  Assisting and Planning","  Mathematical models could be helpful in assisting the Indian Government's new
initiative of issuing biometric cards to its citizens. In this note, we look
into the role of mathematical models in estimating the missing, non-enumerated
population numbers, estimating annual numbers of cards required by age, gender
and regions in India. The linkage between National Population Register and
biometric cards is also highlighted. See technical Appendices. There are other
scientific issues, namely, electronic, data storage management, identity

1104.5008,2017-04-26,What does photon energy tell us about cellphone safety?,"  It has been argued that cellphones are safe because a single microwave photon
does not have enough energy to break a chemical bond. We show that cellphone
technology operates in the classical wave limit, not the single photon limit.
Based on energy densities relative to thermal energy, we estimate thresholds at
which effects might be expected. These seem to correspond somewhat with many
experimental observations.

  Matrix of Alginate/Magnetic Nanoparticles, on Chitosan-Magnetite
  Microparticles and Cellulose-coated Magnetic Nanoparticles","  Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were entrapped in matrix of alginate and
magnetic nanoparticles and covalently immobilized on magnetite-containing
chitosan and cellulose-coated magnetic nanoparticles. Cellulose-coated magnetic
nanoparticles with covalently immobilized thermostable {\alpha}-amylase and
chitosan particles with immobilized glucoamylase were also prepared. The
immobilized cells and enzymes were applied in column reactors - 1/for
simultaneous corn starch saccharification with the immobilized glucoamylase and
production of ethanol with the entrapped or covalently immobilized yeast cells,
2/ for separate ethanol fermentation of the starch hydrolysates with the fixed
yeasts. Hydrolysis of corn starch with the immobilized {\alpha}-amylase and
glucoamylase, and separate hydrolysis with the immobilized {\alpha}-amylase
were also examined. In the first reactor the ethanol yield reached approx. 91%
of the theoretical; the yield was approx. 86% in the second. The ethanol
fermentation was affected by the type of immobilization, the initial particle
loading, feed sugar concentration and the dilution rate. The ethanol
productivity with entrapped cells reached 264.0 g/L.h at particle loading rate
70% and dilution rate 3.0 h-1 with reducing sugar concentration of 200.0 g/L.
The prepared magnetic particles with fixed yeast cells were stable at 4oC in

1105.6282,2011-06-01,Quantum theory of hydrogen key of point mutation in DNA,"  Quantum theory of hydrogen atoms distribution between two complementary
nucleotide bases in DNA double helix at moment of replication has been proposed
in this work. It bases on two mechanisms of proton tunneling: the
Andreev-Meyerovich mechanism with spontaneous phonon radiation and the
Kagan-Maximov (Flynn-Stoneham) mechanism at phonon scattering. According to the
presented model, the probability of proton location in shallow potential well
(point mutation form) is directly proportional to temperature. It was shown
that the point mutation probability decreases with increasing replication
velocity.

1107.1623,2011-09-26,Mean-field theory of collective motion due to velocity alignment,"  We introduce a system of self-propelled agents (active Brownian particles)
with velocity alignment in two spatial dimensions and derive a mean-field
theory from the microscopic dynamics via a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation and
a moment expansion of the probability distribution function. We analyze the
stationary solutions corresponding to macroscopic collective motion with finite
center of mass velocity (ordered state) and the disordered solution with no
collective motion in the spatially homogeneous system. In particular, we
discuss the impact of two different propulsion functions governing the
individual dynamics. Our results predict a strong impact of the individual
dynamics on the mean field onset of collective motion (continuous vs
discontinuous). In addition to the macroscopic density and velocity field we
consider explicitly the dynamics of an effective temperature of the agent
system, representing a measure of velocity fluctuations around the mean
velocity. We show that the temperature decreases strongly with increasing level
of collective motion despite constant fluctuations on individual level, which
suggests that extreme caution should be taken in deducing individual behavior,
such as, state-dependent individual fluctuations from mean-field measurements

1107.1998,2011-07-20,Genetic Code: Four Diversity Types of Protein Amino Acids,"  This paper presents, for the first time, four diversity types of protein
amino acids. The first type includes two amino acids (G, P), both without
standard hydrocarbon side chains; the second one four amino acids, as two pairs
[(A, L), (V, I)], all with standard hydrocarbon side chains; the third type
comprises the six amino acids, as three pairs [(F, Y), (H, W), (C, M)], two
aromatic, two hetero aromatic and two ""hetero"" non-aromatic); finally, the
fourth type consists of eight amino acids, as four pairs [(S, T), (D, E), (N,
Q), (K, R)], all with a functional group which also exists in amino acid
functional group (wholly presented: H2N-\.CH-COOH; separately: OH, COOH, CONH2,
NH2). The insight into existence of four types of diversity was possible only
after an insight into the existence of some very new arithmetical regularities,
which were so far unknown. Also, as for showing these four types was necessary
to reveal the relationships between several key harmonic structures of the
genetic code (which we presented in our previous works), this paper is also a
review article of the author's researches of the genetic code. By this, the
review itself shows that the said harmonic structures are connected through the
same (or near the same) chemically determined amino acid pairs, 10 pairs out of
the 190 possible.

knowledge (biomarkers, brain structure, behavior, cognitive impairment). Our
aim was to develop and to apply a protocol of programmed physical activity
according to a non-linear methodology to enhance or diminish the deterioration
of cognitive and motor functions of adults with this disease, using concepts of
complexity theory for planning and programing the program. We evaluated 18
patients (12 women and 6 men) diagnosed with mild and moderate grade. We worked
in small groups (2 people/coach), a total of 16 weeks, 5 sessions per week and
60 minutes per session. We designed a protocol that integrated work balance,
joint mobility, coordination, muscular strength and metabolic efficiency. The
strong point of this intervention was how to design the planning of tasks for
patients. The tasks were developed in parallel to processes of evocation and
cognitive association individually designed and presented in order of
complexity. In all subjects studied, we found an improvement in the results
obtained in the Mini-Mental State Examination screening test, test of Cricthon,
Set-Test of Isaacs, Clock Drawing Test and Trail Making Test, and the
evaluation test of fitness. The physical activity program designed and the
methodology used, has been an adecuated tool to improve quality of life and

1109.5979,2012-02-21,"The interplay of mutations and electronic properties in disease-related
  genes","  Electronic properties of DNA are believed to play a crucial role in many
phenomena in living organisms, for example the location of DNA lesions by base
excision repair (BER) glycosylases and the regulation of tumor-suppressor genes
such as p53 by detection of oxidative damage. However, the reproducible
measurement and modelling of charge migration through DNA molecules at the
nanometer scale remains a challenging and controversial subject even after more
than a decade of intense efforts. Here we show, by analysing 162
disease-related genes from a variety of medical databases with a total of
almost 20,000 observed pathogenic mutations, a significant difference in the
electronic properties of the population of observed mutations compared to the
set of all possible mutations. Our results have implications for the role of
the electronic properties of DNA in cellular processes, and hint at the
possibility of prediction, early diagnosis and detection of mutation hotspots.

1109.6065,2015-03-13,Conformation changes and protein folding induced by \phi^4 interaction,"  A model to describe the mechanism of conformational dynamics in protein based
on matter interactions using lagrangian approach and imposing certain symmetry
breaking is proposed. Both conformation changes of proteins and the injected
non-linear sources are represented by the bosonic lagrangian with an additional
\phi^4 interaction for the sources. In the model the spring tension of protein
representing the internal hydrogen bonds is realized as the interactions
between individual amino acids and nonlinear sources. The folding pathway is
determined by the strength of nonlinear sources that propagate through the
protein backbone. It is also shown that the model reproduces the results in
some previous works.

1110.1739,2015-05-30,"Dynamical modeling of collective behavior from pigeon flight data: flock
  cohesion and dispersion","  Several models of flocking have been promoted based on simulations with
qualitatively naturalistic behavior. In this paper we provide the first direct
application of computational modeling methods to infer flocking behavior from
experimental field data. We show that this approach is able to infer general
rules for interaction, or lack of interaction, among members of a flock or,
more generally, any community. Using experimental field measurements of homing
pigeons in flight we demonstrate the existence of a basic distance dependent
attraction/repulsion relationship and show that this rule is sufficient to
explain collective behavior observed in nature. Positional data of individuals
over time are used as input data to a computational algorithm capable of
building complex nonlinear functions that can represent the system behavior.
Topological nearest neighbor interactions are considered to characterize the
components within this model. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated with
simulated noisy data generated from the classical (two dimensional) Vicsek
model. When applied to experimental data from homing pigeon flights we show
that the more complex three dimensional models are capable of predicting and
simulating trajectories, as well as exhibiting realistic collective dynamics.
The simulations of the reconstructed models are used to extract properties of
the collective behavior in pigeons, and how it is affected by changing the
initial conditions of the system. Our results demonstrate that this approach
may be applied to construct models capable of simulating trajectories and
collective dynamics using experimental field measurements of herd movement.
From these models, the behavior of the individual agents (animals) may be
inferred.

combination of vaccinotherapy, chemotherapy and surgical excision of primary
tumor nodes, and also the comparative analyses of therapeutic and preventive
application of antitumoral vaccines were carried out in melanoma experimental

1110.3398,2011-10-18,Free Final-Time Optimal Control for HIV Viral Dynamics,"  In this paper, we examine a well-established model for HIV wild-type
infection. The algorithm for steepest descent method for fixed final-time is
stated and a modified method for free final-time is presented. The first type
of cost functional considered, seeks to minimize the total time of therapy. An
easy implementation for this problem suggests that it can be effective in the
early stages of treatment as well as for individual-based studies, due to the
""hit first and hit hard"" nature of optimal control.
  An LQR based cost functional is also presented and the solution is found
using steepest descent method. It suggests that the optimal therapy must remain
high until the patient shows signs of recovery after which, the therapy
gradually decreases. This is in line with the biomedical philosophy. Solution
to a modified problem which includes a weight for total time is approximated
using the modified algorithm. It shows a considerable drop in the total period.
We conclude that, a decreased and optimized therapy period can help us increase
efficiency as well as the turnover rate for patient care.

1110.5265,2011-10-25,On Programs and Genomes,"  We outline the global control architecture of genomes. A theory of genomic
control information is presented. The concept of a developmental control
network called a cene (for control gene) is introduced. We distinguish
parts-genes from control genes or cenes. Cenes are interpreted and executed by
the cell and, thereby, direct cell actions including communication, growth,
division, differentiation and multi-cellular development. The cenome is the
global developmental control network in the genome. The cenome is also a cene
that consists of interlinked sub-cenes that guide the ontogeny of the organism.
The complexity of organisms is linked to the complexity of the cenome. The
relevance to ontogeny and evolution is mentioned. We introduce the concept of a
universal cell and a universal genome.

the spectrum of mean first-passage times, the Fokker-Planck equation allows us
to derive the diffusivity profile along the separation coordinate and thus to
unambiguously disentangle the effects of free-energy and local friction on the
separation kinetics. For tightly coordinated water the friction is six times
higher than in bulk, which can be interpreted in terms of a dominant reaction

1111.6488,2012-12-04,Neuroeconomics of suicide,"  Suicidal behavior is a leading cause of injury and death worldwide. Suicide
has been associated with psychiatric illnesses such as depression and
schizophrenia, as well as economic uncertainty, and social/cultural factors.
This study proposes a neuroeconomic framework of suicide. Neuroeconomic
parameters (e.g., risk-attitude, probability weighting, time discounting in
intertemporal choice, and loss aversion) are predicted to be related to
suicidal behavior. Neurobiological and neuroendocrinological substrates such as
serotonin, dopamine, cortisol (HPA axis), nitric oxide, serum cholesterol,
epinephrine, norepinephrine, gonadal hormones (e.g., estradiol and
progesterone), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in brain regions such as the
orbitofrontal/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and limbic regions (e.g., the
amygdala) may supposedly be related to the neuroeconomic parameters modulating
the risk of suicide. The present framework puts foundations for ""molecular
neuroeconomics"" of decision-making processes underlying suicidal behavior.

1111.6489,2012-12-04,"Stress hormones predict hyperbolic time-discount rates six months later
  in adults","  Objectives: Stress hormones have been associated with temporal discounting.
Although time-discount rate is shown to be stable over a long term, no study to
date examines whether individual differences in stress hormones could predict
individuals' time-discount rates in the relatively distant future (e.g., six
month later), which is of interest in neuroeconomics of stress-addiction
association.
  Methods: We assessed 87 participants' salivary stress hormone (cortisol,
cortisone, and alpha-amylase) levels and hyperbolic discounting of delayed
rewards consisting of three magnitudes, at the time-interval of six months. For
salivary steroid assays, we employed a liquid chromatography/ mass spectroscopy
(LC/MS) method. The correlations between the stress hormone levels and
time-discount rates were examined.
  Results: We observed that salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) levels were negatively
associated with time-discount rates in never-smokers. Notably, salivary levels
of stress steroids (i.e., cortisol and cortisone) negatively and positively
related to time-discount rates in men and women, respectively, in
never-smokers. Ever-smokers' discount rates were not predicted from these
stress hormone levels.
  Conclusions: Individual differences in stress hormone levels predict
impulsivity in temporal discounting in the future. There are sex differences in
the effect of stress steroids on temporal discounting; while there was no sex
defference in the relationship between sAA and temporal discounting.

  based on Tsallis' statistics","  Depression has been associated with impaired neural processing of reward and
punishment. However, to date, little is known regarding the relationship
between depression and intertemporal choice for gain and loss. We compared
impulsivity and inconsistency in intertemporal choice for monetary gain and
loss (quantified with parameters in the q-exponential discount function based
on Tsallis' statistics) between depressive patients and healthy control
subjects. This examination is potentially important for advances in
neuroeconomics of intertemporal choice, because depression is associated with
reduced serotonergic activities in the brain. We observed that depressive
patients were more impulsive and time-inconsistent in intertemporal choice
action for gain and loss, in comparison to healthy controls. The usefulness of
the q-exponential discount function for assessing the impaired decision-making
by depressive patients was demonstrated. Furthermore, biophysical mechanisms
underlying the altered intertemporal choice by depressive patients are
discussed in relation to impaired serotonergic neural systems.

1111.6494,2011-11-29,Toward molecular neuroeconomics of obesity,"  Because obesity is a risk factor for many serious illnesses such as diabetes,
better understandings of obesity and eating disorders have been attracting
attention in neurobiology, psychiatry, and neuroeconomics. This paper presents
future study directions by unifying (i) economic theory of addiction and
obesity (Becker and Murphy, 1988; Levy 2002; Dragone 2009), and (ii) recent
empirical findings in neuroeconomics and neurobiology of obesity and addiction.
It is suggested that neurobiological substrates such as adiponectin, dopamine
(D2 receptors), endocannabinoids, ghrelin, leptin, nesfatin-1, norepinephrine,
orexin, oxytocin, serotonin, vasopressin, CCK, GLP-1, MCH, PYY, and stress
hormones (e.g., CRF) in the brain (e.g., OFC, VTA, NAcc, and the hypothalamus)
may determine parameters in the economic theory of obesity. Also, the
importance of introducing time-inconsistent and gain/loss-asymmetrical temporal
discounting (intertemporal choice) models based on Tsallis' statistics and
incorporating time-perception parameters into the neuroeconomic theory is
emphasized. Future directions in the application of the theory to studies in
neuroeconomics and neuropsychiatry of obesity at the molecular level, which may
help medical/psychopharmacological treatments of obesity (e.g., with
sibutramine), are discussed.

(Bienenstock, Cooper, Munro, 1982) based on recent findings in neuroeconomics
and neurobiology of addiction. Furthermore, it is suggested that several
neurobiological substrates such as cortisol (a stress hormone), NMDA and AMPA
receptors/subunits and intracellular calcium in the postsynaptic neurons are
critical factors determining parameters in Becker and Murphy's economic theory
of addiction. Future directions in the application of the theory to studies in

1111.6496,2012-12-04,Theoretical frameworks for neuroeconomics of intertemporal choice,"  Intertemporal choice has drawn attention in behavioral economics,
econophysics, and neuroeconomics. Recent studies in mainstream economics have
mainly focused on inconsistency in intertemporal choice (dynamic
inconsistency); while impulsivity/impatience in intertemporal choice has been
extensively studied in behavioral economics of addiction. However, recent
advances in neuroeconomic and econophysical studies on intertemporal choice
have made it possible to study both impulsivity and inconsistency in
intertemporal choice within a unified framework. In this paper I propose the
new frameworks for investigations into neuroeconomics of intertemporal choice.
The importance of studying neurochemical and neuroendocrinological modulations
of intertemporal choice and time-perception (e.g. serotonin, dopamine,
cortisol, testosterone, and epinephrine) is emphasized.

1112.5921,2011-12-30,"Systematic Approach on Differences in Avian Viral Proteins Based on
  Carbon Composition","  The distribution of amino acid along the protein sequences plays an
imperative role in facilitating different biological functions. Currently,
there is insufficient scientific data, which represents the arrangement of
amino acid in the proteins based on atomic composition. Our deep observational
and analytical studies indicate that the distribution of carbon in the protein
sequence can bring differences in the function of proteins. Until now, it is
believed that carbon content elicits the hydrophobic interactions in proteins.
This distinct feature classifies normal proteins and viral proteins based on
the carbon content. One of the objectives of this investigation is to show the
significance of carbon composition in protein structure evaluation. Since, the
level of perceived benefit is likely to be high in the field of proteomics for
structural analysis, the position of this paper is to prioritize only the avian
viral protein sequences based on carbon content when compared with the normal
protein sequences. Here, we present the evaluation of carbon along the avian
protein sequence in order to show the differences in the distribution of carbon
using the software technology. The evaluation results provide a deep view in to
the molecular structure of avian viral protein, which can further enable the
progress of research in the proteomics domain based on carbon classification.
This systematic approach in computing carbon level of avian viruses aim towards
the benefit of individual, regional and global health in addition to opening of
further effective research on avian viral protein based on the aforementioned

  New Formula that Improves van't Hoff Osmotic Pressure Equation","  Experimental data were used to support a new concept of osmotic force and a
new osmotic law that can explain the osmotic process without the difficulties
encountered with van't Hoff osmotic pressure theory. Derived new osmotic
formula with curvilinear equation (via new osmotic law) overcomes the
limitations and incompleteness of van't Hoff (linear) osmotic pressure
equation, $\pi=(n/v)RT$, (for ideal dilute solution only). The application of
this classical theory often resulted in contradiction regardless of
miscellaneous explaining efforts. This is due to the lack of a scientific

Via this new concept, the proposed new osmotic law and derived new osmotic

1201.2069,2012-01-11,"No entailing laws, but enablement in the evolution of the biosphere","  Biological evolution is a complex blend of ever changing structural
stability, variability and emergence of new phenotypes, niches, ecosystems. We
wish to argue that the evolution of life marks the end of a physics world view
of law entailed dynamics. Our considerations depend upon discussing the
variability of the very ""contexts of life"": the interactions between organisms,
biological niches and ecosystems. These are ever changing, intrinsically
indeterminate and even unprestatable: we do not know ahead of time the ""niches""
which constitute the boundary conditions on selection. More generally, by the
mathematical unprestatability of the ""phase space"" (space of possibilities), no
laws of motion can be formulated for evolution. We call this radical emergence,
from life to life. The purpose of this paper is the integration of variation
and diversity in a sound conceptual frame and situate unpredictability at a
novel theoretical level, that of the very phase space. Our argument will be
carried on in close comparisons with physics and the mathematical constructions
of phase spaces in that discipline. The role of (theoretical) symmetries as
invariant preserving transformations will allow us to understand the nature of
physical phase spaces and to stress the differences required for a sound
biological theoretizing. In this frame, we discuss the novel notion of
""enablement"". This will restrict causal analyses to differential cases (a
difference that causes a difference). Mutations or other causal differences
will allow us to stress that ""non conservation principles"" are at the core of
evolution, in contrast to physical dynamics, largely based on conservation
principles as symmetries. Critical transitions, the main locus of symmetry
changes in physics, will be discussed, and lead to ""extended criticality"" as a
conceptual frame for a better understanding of the living state of matter.

1201.5827,2018-09-05,"Individual rules for trail pattern formation in Argentine ants
  (Linepithema humile)","  We studied the formation of trail patterns by Argentine ants exploring an
empty arena. Using a novel imaging and analysis technique we estimated
pheromone concentrations at all spatial positions in the experimental arena and
at different times. Then we derived the response function of individual ants to
pheromone concentrations by looking at correlations between concentrations and
changes in speed or direction of the ants. Ants were found to turn in response
to local pheromone concentrations, while their speed was largely unaffected by
these concentrations. Ants did not integrate pheromone concentrations over
time, with the concentration of pheromone in a 1 cm radius in front of the ant
determining the turning angle. The response to pheromone was found to follow a
Weber's Law, such that the difference between quantities of pheromone on the
two sides of the ant divided by their sum determines the magnitude of the
turning angle. This proportional response is in apparent contradiction with the
well-established non-linear choice function used in the literature to model the
results of binary bridge experiments in ant colonies (Deneubourg et al. 1990).
However, agent based simulations implementing the Weber's Law response function
led to the formation of trails and reproduced results reported in the
literature. We show analytically that a sigmoidal response, analogous to that
in the classical Deneubourg model for collective decision making, can be
derived from the individual Weber-type response to pheromone concentrations
that we have established in our experiments when directional noise around the
preferred direction of movement of the ants is assumed.

1202.2353,2012-02-14,p-Adic Structure of the Genetic Code,"  The genetic code is connection between 64 codons, which are building blocks
of the genes, and 20 amino acids, which are building blocks of the proteins. In
addition to coding amino acids, a few codons code stop signal, which is at the
end of genes, i.e. it terminates process of protein synthesis. This article is
a review of simple modelling of the genetic code and related subjects by
concept of p-adic distance. It also contains some new results. In particular,
the article presents appropriate structure of the codon space, degeneration and
possible evolution of the genetic code. p-Adic modelling of the genetic code is
viewed as the first step in further application of p-adic tools in the
information sector of life science.

1203.3554,2013-03-18,"Stochastic Physics, Complex Systems and Biology","  In complex systems, the interplay between nonlinear and stochastic dynamics,
e.g., J. Monod's necessity and chance, gives rise to an evolutionary process in
Darwinian sense, in terms of discrete jumps among attractors, with punctuated
equilibrium, spontaneous random ""mutations"" and ""adaptations"". On an
evlutionary time scale it produces sustainable diversity among individuals in a
homogeneous population rather than convergence as usually predicted by a
deterministic dynamics. The emergent discrete states in such a system, i.e.,
attractors, have natural robustness against both internal and external
perturbations. Phenotypic states of a biological cell, a mesoscopic nonlinear
stochastic open biochemical system, could be understood through such a
perspective.

1203.4289,2015-01-14,"Health Matters: Human Organ Donations, Sales, and the Black Market","  In this paper I explore the human organ procurement system. Which is better
for saving lives and limiting black market use, the present altruistic system
of donations or a free and open sales market? I explain that there is a risk
with maintaining the present system, the altruistic vision, and that people may
die who might otherwise live if the sale of organs was permitted. But there is
no guarantee that permitting organ sales would effectively address the current
supply-side shortage and global use of the black market. In addition to
discussing the implications of these procurement systems, I look at methods to
increase organ donations and I explore the differences between presumed and
explicit consent. Ultimately, I conclude that the altruistic donation system,
bolstered by the addition of a policy of presumed consent and appropriate
financial incentives, is a better choice than a legal sales market in spite of
its shortcomings.

1204.2525,2012-08-23,"Field-control, phase-transitions, and life's emergence","  Instances of critical-like characteristics in living systems at each
organizational level as well as the spontaneous emergence of computation
(Langton), indicate the relevance of self-organized criticality (SOC). But
extrapolating complex bio-systems to life's origins, brings up a paradox: how
could simple organics--lacking the 'soft matter' response properties of today's
bio-molecules--have dissipated energy from primordial reactions in a controlled
manner for their 'ordering'? Nevertheless, a causal link of life's macroscopic
irreversible dynamics to the microscopic reversible laws of statistical
mechanics is indicated via the 'functional-takeover' of a soft magnetic
scaffold by organics (c.f. Cairns-Smith's 'crystal-scaffold'). A
field-controlled structure offers a mechanism for bootstrapping--bottom-up
assembly with top-down control: its super-paramagnetic components obey
reversible dynamics, but its dissipation of H-field energy for aggregation
breaks time-reversal symmetry. The responsive adjustments of the controlled
(host) mineral system to environmental changes would bring about mutual
coupling between random organic sets supported by it; here the generation of
long-range correlations within organic (guest) networks could include SOC-like
mechanisms. And, such cooperative adjustments enable the selection of the
functional configuration by altering the inorganic network's capacity to assist
a spontaneous process. A non-equilibrium dynamics could now drive the
kinetically-oriented system towards a series of phase-transitions with
appropriate organic replacements 'taking-over' its functions.

1204.3236,2012-04-17,Using Mimicry to Learn about Mental Representations,"  Phonology typically describes speech in terms of discrete signs like
features. The field of intonational phonology uses discrete accents to describe
intonation and prosody. But, are such representations useful? The results of
mimicry experiments indicate that discrete signs are not a useful
representation of the shape of intonation contours. Human behaviour seems to be
better represented by a attractors where memory retains substantial fine detail
about an utterance. There is no evidence that discrete abstract representations
that might be formed that have an effect on the speech that is subsequently
produced. This paper also discusses conditions under which a discrete phonology
can arise from an attractor model and why - for intonation - attractors can be
inferred without the implying a discrete phonology.

1204.6231,2012-04-30,"Quantifying Limits to Detection of Early Warning for Critical
  Transitions","  Catastrophic regime shifts in complex natural systems may be averted through
advanced detection. Recent work has provided a proof-of-principle that many
systems approaching a catastrophic transition may be identified through the
lens of early warning indicators such as rising variance or increased return
times. Despite widespread appreciation of the difficulties and uncertainty
involved in such forecasts, proposed methods hardly ever characterize their
expected error rates. Without the benefits of replicates, controls, or
hindsight, applications of these approaches must quantify how reliable
different indicators are in avoiding false alarms, and how sensitive they are
to missing subtle warning signs. We propose a model based approach in order to
quantify this trade-off between reliability and sensitivity and allow
comparisons between different indicators. We show these error rates can be
quite severe for common indicators even under favorable assumptions, and also
illustrate how a model-based indicator can improve this performance. We
demonstrate how the performance of an early warning indicator varies in
different data sets, and suggest that uncertainty quantification become a more
central part of early warning predictions.

1204.6247,2013-01-18,"Dyadic groups, dyadic trees and symmetries in long nucleotide sequences","  The conception of multi-alphabetical genetics is represented. Matrix forms of
the representation of the multi-level system of molecular-genetic alphabets
have revealed algebraic properties of this system. These properties are
connected with well-known notions of dyadic groups and dyadic-shift matrices.
Matrix genetics shows relations of the genetic alphabets with some types of
hypercomplex numbers including dual numbers and bicomplex numbers together with
their extensions. A possibility of new approach is mentioned to simulate
genetically inherited phenomena of biological spirals and phyllotaxis laws on
the base of screw theory and Fibonacci matrices. Dyadic trees for sub-sets of
triplets of the whole human genome are constructed. A new notion is put forward
about square matrices with internal complementarities on the base of genetic
matrices. Initial results of the study of such matrices are described. Our
results testify that living matter possesses a profound algebraic essence. They
show new promising ways to develop algebraic biology.
"
1204.6670,2012-05-01,Fundamental Complexity Measures of Life,"  At present, there is a great deal of confusion regarding complexity and its
measures (reviews on complexity measures are found in, e.g. Lloyd, 2001 and
Shalizi, 2006 and more references therein). Moreover, there is also confusion
regarding the nature of life. In this situation, it seems the task of
determining the fundamental complexity measures of life is especially
difficult. Yet this task is just part of a greater task: obtaining substantial
insights into the nature of biological evolution. We think that without a firm
quantitative basis characterizing the most fundamental aspects of life, it is
impossible to overcome the confusion so as to clarify the nature of biological
evolution. The approach we present here offers such quantitative measures of
complexity characterizing biological organization and, as we will see,
evolution.

1205.0931,2018-05-24,Parent-offspring Conflict in feral dogs: A Bioassay,"  The parent-offspring conflict theory is an interesting premise for
understanding the dynamics of parental care. However, this theory is not easy
to test empirically, as exact measures of parental investment in an
experimental set-up are difficult to obtain. We have used the Indian feral dog
as a model system to test the POC theory in their natural habitat in the
context of the mother's tendency to share food given by humans with her pups in
the weaning and post-weaning stage. Our behavioural bioassay convincingly
demonstrates an increase of conflict and decrease of cooperation by the mother
with her offspring over a span of 4-6 weeks. We also demonstrate that the
conflict is intentional, and is not influenced by the hunger levels of the pups
or the litter size.
"
1205.1158,2013-07-23,The Geometry of Morphogenesis and the Morphogenetic Field Concept,"  The process of morphogenesis, which can be defined as an evolution of the
form of an organism, is one of the most intriguing mysteries in the life
sciences. It is clear, that gene expression patterns cannot explain the
development of the precise geometry of an organism and its parts in space.
Here, we suggest a set of postulates and possible approaches for discovering
the correspondence between molecular biological information and its realization
in a given geometry of an organism in space-time. First, we suggest that the
geometry of the organism and its parts is coded by a molecular code located on
the cell surfaces in such a way that, with each cell, there can be associated a
corresponding matrix, containing this code. As a particular model, we propose
coding by several types of oligosaccharide residues of glycoconjugates. Second,
we provide a notion of cell event, and suggest a description of development as
a tree of cell events, where under cell event we understand the changing of
cell state, e.g. the processes of cell division, cell growth/death, shift or
differentiation. Next we suggest describing these cell motion laws using the
notion of a ""morphogenetic field"", meaning by the field an object in an ""event
space"" over a ""cell space"", which govern the transformation of the coded
biological information into an instructive signal for a cell event for a given
cell, depending on the position of a cell in the developing embryo. The matrix
on a cell surface will be changed after each cell event according to the
rule(s) dictated by the morphogenetic field of an organism. Finally, we provide
some ideas on the connection between morphogenetic code on a cell surface, cell
motion law(s) and the geometry of an embryo.

1205.4134,2012-05-21,Photonic Communications and Information Encoding in Biological Systems,"  The structure of optical radiation emitted by the samples of loach fish eggs
is studied. It was found earlier that such radiation perform the communications
between distant samples, which result in the synchronization of their
development. The photon radiation in form of short quasi-periodic bursts was
observed for fish and frog eggs, hence the communication mechanism can be
similar to the exchange of binary encoded data in the computer nets via the
noisy channels. The data analysis of fish egg radiation demonstrates that in
this case the information encoding is similar to the digit to time analogue
algorithm.

1205.5260,2012-05-24,Free flight of the mosquito Aedes aegypti,"  High speed video observations of free flying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes,
the dengue and yellow fever vector, along with custom measurement methods,
enable measurement of wingbeat frequency, body position and body orientation of
mosquitoes during flight. We find these mosquitoes flap their wings at
approximately 850 Hz. We also generate body yaw, body pitch and wing deviation
measurements with standard deviations of less than 1 degree and find that
sideways velocity and acceleration are important components of mosquito motion.
Rapid turns involving changes in flight direction often involve large sideways
accelerations. These do not correspond to commensurate changes in body heading,
and the insect's flight direction and body heading are decoupled during flight.
These findings call in to question the role of yaw control in mosquito flight.
In addition, using orientation data, we find that sideways accelerations are
well explained by roll-based rotation of the lift vector. In contrast, the
insect's body pitch angle does not correlate with its forward acceleration.
This implies that controlling body roll is important to mosquito dynamics. The
dynamic importance of stabilizing body pitch and body yaw is less clear.

1206.1029,2012-06-06,Influenza Virus Vaccine Efficacy Based On Conserved Sequence Alignment,"  The rapid outbreak of bird flu challenges the outcome of effective vaccine
for the upcoming years. The recent research established different norms to
eliminate flu pandemics. This can be made possible with skilled experimental
analyses and by tracking the recent virulent strain and can be broadly
applicable with effective testing of vaccine efficacy. Every year World Health
Organization (WHO) reveals the administration of drug and vaccine to counter
arrest the spread of flu among the population. As there are recurrent failures
in priming the population, the complete eradication of the flu pandemic is
still appears to be an unresolved problem. To overcome the current scenario,
high level efforts with theoretical and practical research is required and it
can enhance the scope in this field. The recent advancements also allow the
researchers to endeavor effective vaccine to meet the emerging flu types. Only
the standardized vaccination among the population at the time of flu pandemics
will revolutionalize the current propositions against influenza virus. This
paper shows the deficiencies of vaccine fitness research as there are reported
failures and less efficacy of vaccine even after priming the population from
referred evidences and studies. It also shows simple experimental approach in
detecting the effective vaccine among the vaccines announced by WHO.

  into DNA reveals novel long-distance genome organization","  Zero mode waveguide technology of next generation sequencing demonstrated
sequence-dependence of the enzymatic reaction, incorporating a base into the
genomic DNA. We show that these experimental results indicate existence of a
previously uncharacterized physical property of DNA, the incorporation reaction
chemical potential {\Delta}{\mu}. We use the combination of graph theory and
statistical thermodynamics to derive entromics - a series of results providing
the thermodynamic model of {\Delta}{\mu}. We also show that {\Delta}{\mu}i is
quantitatively characterized as incorporation entropy. We present formulae for
computing {\Delta}{\mu} from the genome DNA sequence. We then derive important
restrictions on DNA properties and genome assembly that follow from
thermodynamic properties of {\Delta}{\mu}. Finally, we show how these genome
assembly restrictions lead directly to the evolution of detectable coherences
in incorporation entropy along the entire genome. Examples of entromic
applications, demonstrating functional and biological importance are shown.
"
1206.6490,2012-07-06,Living Devices,"  The physiological tradition of biological research analyzes biological
systems using reduced descriptions much as an engineer uses a 'black box'
description of an amplifier. Simple models have been used by physiologists for
a very long time. Physiologists have successfully analyzed a broad range of
biological systems using a 'device-oriented' approach similar to the approach
an engineer would use to investigate her devices. The present generation views
biology through the powerful lenses of structural and (molecular) dynamic
analysis, understandably enough because of the beauty and power of the
analysis, and the ease of using these structures with present freely available
software. The problem is that these powerful lenses offer such magnification
that the engineering approach cannot be seen. High magnification means limited
field of view, because the (spatial) dynamic range cannot cover everything. The
function of the structures and molecular dynamics cannot be seen in the work of
many biologists, probably because function cannot be immediately seen in the
structures and molecular dynamics they compute. It is just as important for
biologists to measure the inputs and outputs of their systems as it is to
measure their structures. It seems clear, at least to one physiologist, that
this research will be catalyzed by assuming that most biological systems are
devices that can be analyzed with the same strategies one would use to analyze
engineering devices. Thinking today about your biological preparation as a
device tells you what experiments to do tomorrow. An important task for many of
us is to transmit the physiological tradition to the next generation of
biophysicists to help them adapt traditional questions to the new length scales
and techniques of molecular and atomic biology.

reduce the case reproduction number for HIV to less than one, eliminate

1207.2929,2012-07-13,Soft Active Matter,"  In this review we summarize theoretical progress in the field of active
matter, placing it in the context of recent experiments. Our approach offers a
unified framework for the mechanical and statistical properties of living
matter: biofilaments and molecular motors in vitro or in vivo, collections of
motile microorganisms, animal flocks, and chemical or mechanical imitations. A
major goal of the review is to integrate the several approaches proposed in the
literature, from semi-microscopic to phenomenological. In particular, we first
consider ""dry"" systems, defined as those where momentum is not conserved due to
friction with a substrate or an embedding porous medium, and clarify the
differences and similarities between two types of orientationally ordered
states, the nematic and the polar. We then consider the active hydrodynamics of
a suspension, and relate as well as contrast it with the dry case. We further
highlight various large-scale instabilities of these nonequilibrium states of
matter. We discuss and connect various semi-microscopic derivations of the
continuum theory, highlighting the unifying and generic nature of the continuum
model. Throughout the review, we discuss the experimental relevance of these
theories for describing bacterial swarms and suspensions, the cytoskeleton of
living cells, and vibrated granular materials. We suggest promising extensions
towards greater realism in specific contexts from cell biology to ethology, and
remark on some exotic active-matter analogues. Lastly, we summarize the outlook
for a quantitative understanding of active matter, through the interplay of
detailed theory with controlled experiments on simplified systems, with living
or artificial constituents.

1207.4737,2012-08-31,Life's Solutions are Complex Fluids. A Mathematical Challenge,"  Classical thermodynamics and statistical mechanics describe systems in which
nothing interacts with nothing. Even the highly refined theory of simple fluids
does not deal very well with electrical interactions, boundary conditions, or
flows, if at all. Electrical interactions, boundary conditions, and flows are
essential features of living systems. Life without flow is death and so a
different approach is needed to study biology alive. The theory of complex
fluids deals with interactions, boundary conditions, and flows quite well as
can be seen in its successful treatment of liquid crystals. I advocate treating
ionic solutions in general as complex fluids, with microelements that are the
solutes and components of the solution. Enzyme active sites are a special case
where some solutes are reactants. Solutes are crowded into active sites of
enzyme by the high density of protein charges. The electric field links
chemical reactions to charges in the protein and surrounding solutions.
Interactions potentiate catalysis and control biological function. I suspect
that most chemical reactions that occur in liquids also need to be treated by
the theory of complex fluids. The electron movements of these reactions occur
in a temporary highly concentrated fluctuation, a transient spatial
inhomogeneity in the bulk solution. The electron movements of these reactions
(described by quantum mechanics) are coupled to the electric (and sometimes
steric) fields of the bulk solution. I suspect the electron movements,
inhomogeneities, and chemical reaction (in the condensed phase) need to be
treated by the theory of complex fluids because everything interacts with
everything else, in this system, as in so many others.
"
1207.4803,2012-12-20,The Algorithmic Origins of Life,"  Although it has been notoriously difficult to pin down precisely what it is
that makes life so distinctive and remarkable, there is general agreement that
its informational aspect is one key property, perhaps the key property. The
unique informational narrative of living systems suggests that life may be
characterized by context-dependent causal influences, and in particular, that
top-down (or downward) causation -- where higher-levels influence and constrain
the dynamics of lower-levels in organizational hierarchies -- may be a major
contributor to the hierarchal structure of living systems. Here we propose that
the origin of life may correspond to a physical transition associated with a
shift in causal structure, where information gains direct, and
context-dependent causal efficacy over the matter it is instantiated in. Such a
transition may be akin to more traditional physical transitions (e.g.
thermodynamic phase transitions), with the crucial distinction that determining
which phase (non-life or life) a given system is in requires dynamical
information and therefore can only be inferred by identifying causal
architecture. We discuss some potential novel research directions based on this
hypothesis, including potential measures of such a transition that may be
amenable to laboratory study, and how the proposed mechanism corresponds to the
onset of the unique mode of (algorithmic) information processing characteristic
of living systems.
"
1207.4808,2012-07-23,Evolutionary Transitions and Top-Down Causation,"  Top-down causation has been suggested to occur at all scales of biological
organization as a mechanism for explaining the hierarchy of structure and
causation in living systems. Here we propose that a transition from bottom-up
to top-down causation -- mediated by a reversal in the flow of information from
lower to higher levels of organization, to that from higher to lower levels of
organization -- is a driving force for most major evolutionary transitions. We
suggest that many major evolutionary transitions might therefore be marked by a
transition in causal structure. We use logistic growth as a toy model for
demonstrating how such a transition can drive the emergence of collective
behavior in replicative systems. We then outline how this scenario may have
played out in those major evolutionary transitions in which new, higher levels
of organization emerged, and propose possible methods via which our hypothesis
might be tested.
"
1207.5025,2013-03-14,Mineral bridges in nacre revisited,"  We confirm with high-resolution techniques the existence of mineral bridges
between superposed nacre tablets. In the towered nacre of both gastropods and
the cephalopod Nautilus there are large bridges aligned along the tower axes,
corresponding to gaps (150-200 nm) in the interlamellar membranes. Gaps are
produced by the interaction of the nascent tablets with a surface membrane that
covers the nacre compartment. In the terraced nacre of bivalves bridges
associated with elongated gaps in the interlamellar membrane (> 100 nm) have
mainly been found at or close to the edges of superposed parental tablets. To
explain this placement, we hypothesize that the interlamellar membrane breaks
due to differences in osmotic pressure across it when the interlamellar space
below becomes reduced at an advanced stage of calcification. In no cases are
the minor connections between superimposed tablets (< 60 nm), earlier reported
to be mineral bridges, found to be such.

G(a), with a the shape parameter, which generalizes the Gumbel distribution.
These functions appear in a model of charge transport, when applied to a
metal-insulator-metal structure, where the insulator is constituted by a
monolayer of bacteriorhodopsin. Current shows a sharp increase above about 3 V,
interpreted as the cross-over between direct and injection sequential-tunneling
regimes.
  In particular, we show that, changing the bias value, the probability density
function changes its look from bimodal to unimodal. Actually, the bimodal
distributions can be resolved in at least a couple of $G(a)$ functions with
different values of the shape parameter.

1208.1923,2012-08-10,Potential of Traditional Medicinal Plants for Treating Obesity: A Review,"  Obesity is a global health concern associated with high morbidity and
mortality. Therapeutic strategies include synthetic drugs and surgery, which
may entail high costs and serious complications. Plant-based medicinal agents
offer an alternative approach. A review of the studies on accessible botanical
sources for the treatment of obesity is provided, which attempts to explain how
these medicinal plants act to cause weight loss, and which approach is safer
and more efficient. Information was gathered for the period of 1991 to 2012.
Five basic mechanisms, including stimulating thermogenesis, lowering
lipogenesis, enhancing lipolysis, suppressing appetite, and decreasing the
absorption of lipids may be operating. Consumption of standardized medicinal
plant extracts may be a safe treatment for obesity. However, some combinations
of medicinal plants may result in either lower efficacy or cause unexpected
side-effects.

1208.5035,2015-06-11,DNA sequencing and predictions of the cosmic theory of life,"  The theory of cometary panspermia, developed by the late Sir Fred Hoyle and
the present author argues that life originated cosmically as a unique event in
one of a great multitude of comets or planetary bodies in the Universe. Life on
Earth did not originate here but was introduced by impacting comets, and its
further evolution was driven by the subsequent acquisition of cosmically
derived genes. Explicit predictions of this theory published in 1979-1981,
stating how the acquisition of new genes drives evolution, are compared with
recent developments in relation to horizontal gene transfer, and the role of
retroviruses in evolution. Precisely-stated predictions of the theory of
cometary panspermia are shown to have been verified.

1208.5597,2012-08-29,"Biologists meet statisticians: A workshop for young scientists to foster
  interdisciplinary team work","  Life science and statistics have necessarily become essential partners. The
need to plan complex, structured experiments, involving elaborated designs, and
the need to analyse datasets in the era of systems biology and high throughput
technologies has to build upon professional statistical expertise. On the other
hand, conducting such analyses and also developing improved or new methods,
also for novel kinds of data, has to build upon solid biological understanding
and practise. However, the meeting of scientists of both fields is often
hampered by a variety of communicative hurdles - which are based on
field-specific working languages and cultural differences.
  As a step towards a better mutual understanding, we developed a workshop
concept bringing together young experimental biologists and statisticians, to
work as pairs and learn to value each others competences and practise
interdisciplinary communication in a casual atmosphere. The first
implementation of our concept was a cooperation of the German Region of the
International Biometrical Society and the Leibnitz Institute DSMZ-German
Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (short: DSMZ), Braunschweig,
Germany. We collected feedback in form of three questionnaires, oral comments,
and gathered experiences for the improvement of this concept. The long-term
challenge for both disciplines is the establishment of systematic schedules and
strategic partnerships which use the proposed workshop concept to foster mutual
understanding, to seed the necessary interdisciplinary cooperation network, and
to start training the indispensable communication skills at the earliest
possible phase of education.

1208.5729,2012-08-29,"A Theoretical Mechanism of Szilard Engine Function in Nucleic Acids and
  the Implications for Quantum Coherence in Biological Systems","  Nucleic acids theoretically possess a Szilard engine function that can
convert the energy associated with the Shannon entropy of molecules for which
they have coded recognition, into the useful work of geometric reconfiguration
of the nucleic acid molecule. This function is logically reversible because its
mechanism is literally and physically constructed out of the information
necessary to reduce the Shannon entropy of such molecules, which means that
this information exists on both sides of the theoretical engine, and because
information is retained in the geometric degrees of freedom of the nucleic acid
molecule, a quantum gate is formed through which multi-state nucleic acid
qubits can interact. Entangled biophotons emitted as a consequence of symmetry
breaking nucleic acid Szilard engine (NASE) function can be used to coordinate
relative positioning of different nucleic acid locations, both within and
between cells, thus providing the potential for quantum coherence of an entire

as such ""quantum adaptive systems"" include the potential for multi-agent based
quantum computing, and a better understanding of systemic pathologies such as

1209.0745,2013-02-26,"How can we improve problem-solving in undergraduate biology? Applying
  lessons from 30 years of physics education research","  If students are to successfully grapple with authentic, complex biological
problems as scientists and citizens, they need practice solving such problems
during their undergraduate years. Physics education researchers have
investigated student problem solving for the last three decades. Although
physics and biology problems differ in structure and content, the instructional
purposes align closely: explaining patterns and processes in the natural world
and making predictions about physical and biological systems. In this paper, we
discuss how research-supported approaches developed by physics education
researchers can be adopted by biologists to enhance student problem-solving
skills. First, we compare the problems that biology students are typically
asked to solve with authentic, complex problems. We then describe the
development of research-validated physics curricula emphasizing process skills
in problem solving. We show that solving authentic, complex biology problems
requires many of the same skills that practicing physicists and biologists use
in representing problems, seeking relationships, making predictions, and
verifying or checking solutions. We assert that acquiring these skills can help
biology students become competent problem solvers. Finally, we propose how
biology scholars can apply lessons from physics education in their classrooms
and inspire new studies in biology education research.

However, tests of affine invariance have traditionally been applied to the
consequences of this principle rather to the principle itself. Here, we
designed and performed an original, direct, test of affine invariance in a
scribbling experiment. In each of the 10800 pairs of randomly-selected
scribbling segments, we compared the time parameterizations obtained by
transforming the first segment using four different transportation rules -
affine, equi-affine, Euclidian and constant - with the experimentally-observed
parameterization of the second segment. We observed that, when the two paths
are affinely-similar, the affine transportation of the first segment yields the
time parameterization that best matches the experimental parameterization of
the second segment, which directly demonstrates the existence of affine
invariance in the production of hand movements.

1209.4113,2012-10-05,Quantum Process in Living Cells,"  Quantum processes have been confirmed for various biological phenomena. Here
we model a quantum process in cells based on coherent waves of established
ultrafast energy transfers in water. We compute wave speed, ~156 km/s, and
wavelength, ~9.3 nm, and determine that the waves retain local coherence. The
model is compared with observations and diverse numerical applications lend
support to the hypothesis that rapid energy transfers in water are
characteristic of living cells. Close agreements are found for the dipole
moment of water dimers, microwave radiation on yeast, and the Kleiber law of
metabolic rates. We find a sphere with diameter ~20 nm is a lower bound for
life in this theory. The quantum properties of the model suggest that cellular
chemistry favors reactions that support perpetuation of the energy waves

$R=\F_2[u]/u^4-1$. A mapping is given between the elements of $R$ and the
alphabet $\{A,C,G,T\}$ which allows the additive stem distance to be extended
to this ring. Cyclic codes over $R$ are designed such that their images under
the mapping are also cyclic or quasi-cyclic of index 2. The additive distance
and hybridization energy are functions of the neighborhood energy.

  Mismatch by Refractive Power of Focus-Adjustable 3D Glasses","  The accommodation-vergence mismatch has been considered as a cause of the
visual fatigue induced in watching 3D display. We would propose the mismatch
can be compensated by refractive power of adjustable-focus 3D glasses. From
lens optics and geometrical considerations, we also developed equations that
calculate required refractive power of the 3D glasses. The compensation we

of real genus zero algebraic curves with marked points is a compact aspherical
manifold tiled by associahedra, which resolves the singularities of the space
of phylogenetic trees. In this draft of a sequel, we construct a related
(stacky) resolution of a space of real quadratic forms, and suggest, perhaps
without much justification, that systems of oscillators parametrized by such
objects may may provide useful models in genomics.

1210.0037,2012-10-02,"In Vivo Renal Clearance, Biodistribution, Toxicity of Gold nanoclusters","  Gold nanoparticles have shown great prospective in cancer diagnosis and
therapy, but they can not be metabolized and prefer to accumulate in liver and
spleen due to their large size. The gold nanoclusters with small size can
penetrate kidney tissue and have promise to decrease in vivo toxicity by renal
clearance. In this work, we explore the in vivo renal clearance,
biodistribution, and toxicity responses of the BSA- and GSH-protected gold
nanoclusters for 24 hours and 28 days. The BSA-protected gold nanoclusters have
low-efficient renal clearance and only 1% of gold can be cleared, but the
GSH-protected gold nanoclusters have high-efficient renal clearance and 36 % of
gold can be cleared after 24 hours. The biodistribution further reveals that
94% of gold can be metabolized for the GSH-protected nanoclusters, but only
less than 5% of gold can be metabolized for the BSA-protected nanoclusters
after 28 days. Both of the GSH- and BSA-protected gold nanoclusters cause acute
infection, inflammation, and kidney function damage after 24 hours, but these
toxicity responses for the GSH-protected gold nanoclusters can be eliminated
after 28 days. Immune system can also be affected by the two kinds of gold
nanoclusters, but the immune response for the GSH-protected gold nanoclusters
can also be recovered after 28 days. These findings show that the GSH-protected
gold nanoclusters have small size and can be metabolized by renal clearance and
thus the toxicity can be significantly decreased. The BSA- protected gold
nanoclusters, however, can form large compounds and further accumulate in liver
and spleen which can cause irreparable toxicity response. Therefore, the
GSH-protected gold nanoclusters have great potential for in vivo imaging and
therapy, and the BSA-protected gold nanoclusters can be used as the agent of
liver cancer therapy.

1210.3740,2016-09-13,"Biological Systems as Systems of Increasing Entropy: Language and
  Genetics","  In this paper we will try to provide a formalization of some characteristics
of the development of biological systems aiming at the highest level of
adequacy: justificative adequacy, that is, not only what we observe
(descriptive adequacy) and how we think it occurs (explanatory adequacy) but
also what architectural properties (in terms of matter configuration, for
example) license the occurrence of certain phenomena. In the case of a
biological instantiation of a physical system, justificative adequacy is to be
found in the genotype-phenotype dynamics. Moreover, we will claim that such
dynamics should be analyzed from a mathematical point of view, since the
genotype is hypersensitive to initial conditions: a small change in a certain
state of the system may have drastic effects on the output. Regarding
methodology, we will use chaos theory applied to biology and also physical
genetics in order to frame our research and give it theoretical weight.

1210.5908,2014-02-17,Living is information processing: from molecules to global systems,"  We extend the concept that life is an informational phenomenon, at every
level of organisation, from molecules to the global ecological system.
According to this thesis: (a) living is information processing, in which memory
is maintained by both molecular states and ecological states as well as the
more obvious nucleic acid coding; (b) this information processing has one
overall function - to perpetuate itself; and (c) the processing method is
filtration (cognition) of, and synthesis of, information at lower levels to
appear at higher levels in complex systems (emergence). We show how information
patterns, are united by the creation of mutual context, generating persistent
consequences, to result in `functional information'. This constructive process
forms arbitrarily large complexes of information, the combined effects of which
include the functions of life. Molecules and simple organisms have already been
measured in terms of functional information content; we show how quantification
may be extended to each level of organisation up to the ecological. In terms of
a computer analogy, life is both the data and the program and its biochemical
structure is the way the information is embodied. This idea supports the
seamless integration of life at all scales with the physical universe. The
innovation reported here is essentially to integrate these ideas, basing
information on the `general definition' of information, rather than simply the
statistics of information, thereby explaining how functional information
operates throughout life.

1210.7091,2024-07-02,"Development of Hydrogen Bonding Magnetic Reaction-based Gene Regulation
  through Cyclic Electromagnetic DNA Simulation in Double-Stranded DNA","  The proton-magnetic reaction is commonly used in MRI machines with a strong
magnetic field of over 1 T, while this study hypothesized that the electron
magnetic reaction of hydrogen could affect the hydrogen bonds of
double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) at a low magnetic field below 0.01 T. The goal is
to develop a hydrogen bonding magnetic reaction-based gene regulation (HBMR-GR)
system. The polarities of DNA base pairs are derived from the relative
electrostatic charge between purines and pyrimidines, which become positively
and negatively charged, respectively. The Pyu dsDNAs with
pyrimidine(s)-purine(s) sequences, ds3T3A, ds3C3G, and ds3C3A, showed stronger
DNA hybridization potential, increased infrared absorption at 3400-3200 cm-1,
and a unique DNA conformation in HPLC analysis compared to the corresponding
Puy dsDNAs. To target the three-dimensional structure of dsDNA based on the DNA
base pair polarities, one can use cyclic electromagnetic DNA simulation (CEDS)
with approximately 25% efficiency for randomly oriented dsDNAs. CEDS was found
to induce sequence-specific hybridization of target oligo-dsDNAs in 0.005M NaCl
solution and sequence-specific conformation of oligo-dsDNAs in 0.1M NaCl
solution. It was found that the Pyu oligo-dsDNAs were more responsible for the
hybridization and conformational changes by CEDS than the Puy oligo-dsDNAs.
CEDS decreased ethidium bromide (EtBr) DNA intercalation and spermidine DNA
condensation depending on CEDS time in the binding assay. The results also
included that the Pyu oligo-dsDNAs were more responsible for CEDS by forming
stable and unique conformation of oligo-dsDNA than the Therefore, it is
postulated that the low-level HBMR-based CEDS can enhance the hybridization
potential of oligo-dsDNAs and subsequently lead to the unique DNA conformation
required for the initiation of various DNA functions.

1211.1190,2012-11-07,Field theory approach in the dynamics of biomatter,"  A new approach to model the biomatter dynamics based on the field theory is
presented. It is shown that some well known tools in field theory can be
utilized to describe the physical phenomena in life matters, in particular at
elementary biomatters like DNA and proteins. In this approach, the biomatter
dynamics are represented as results of interactions among its elementary
matters in the form of lagrangian. Starting from the lagrangian would provide
stronger underlying theoretical consideration for further extension. Moreover,
it also enables us to acquire rich physical observables using statistical
mechanics instead of relying on the space-time dynamics from certain equation
of motions which is not solvable due to its nonlinearities. Few examples from
previous results are given and explained briefly.

1211.6644,2012-11-29,"General law of growth and replication. Growth equation and its
  applications","  We present significantly advanced studies of the previously introduced
physical growth mechanism and unite it with biochemical growth factors.
Obtained results allowed formulating the general growth law which governs
growth and evolutional development of all living organisms, their organs and
systems. It was discovered that the growth cycle is predefined by the
distribution of nutritional resources between maintenance needs and biomass
production. This distribution is quantitatively defined by the growth ratio
parameter, which depends on the geometry of an organism, phase of growth and,
indirectly, organism's biochemical machinery. The amount of produced biomass,
in turn, defines the composition of biochemical reactions. Changing amount of
nutrients diverted to biomass production is what forces organisms to proceed
through the whole growth and replication cycle. The growth law can be
formulated as follows: the rate of growth is proportional to influx of
nutrients and growth ratio. Considering specific biochemical components of
different organisms, we find influxes of required nutrients and substitute them
into the growth equation; then, we compute growth curves for amoeba, wild type
fission yeast, fission yeast's mutant. In all cases, predicted growth curves
correspond very well to experimental data. Obtained results prove validity and
fundamental scientific value of the discovery.

links to quantum theory are only beginning to be explored. Whether quantum-like
coherent phenomena are relevant, or even possible at all, at the high
temperatures of biological systems remains unsettled. Here, we present a
broader perspective on biological organization and how quantum-like dynamics
and coherence might shape the very fabric from which complex biological systems
are organized. Regardless of its exact nature, a unique form of coherence seems
apparent at multiple scales in biology and its better characterization may have
broad consequences for the understanding of living organisms as complex

1212.0672,2015-06-12,"The three different phases in the dynamics of chemical reaction networks
  and their relationship to cancer","  We investigate the catalytic reactions model used in cell modeling. The
reaction kinetic is defined through the energies of different species of
molecules following random independent distribution. The related statistical
physics model has three phases and these three phases emerged in the dynamics:
fast dynamics phase, slow dynamic phase and ultra-slow dynamic phase. The
phenomenon we found is a rather general, does not depend on the details of the
model. We assume as a hypothesis that the transition between these phases
(glassiness degrees) is related to cancer. The imbalance in the rate of
processes between key aspects of the cell (gene regulation, protein-protein
interaction, metabolical networks) creates a change in the fine tuning between
these key aspects, affects the logics of the cell and initiates cancer. It is
probable that cancer is a change of phase resulting from increased and
deregulated metabolic reactions.

1301.0953,2013-01-08,"Human anaerobic intestinal ""rope"" parasites","  Human intestinal helminths are described in this paper. They can be over a
meter long, with an irregular cylindrical shape, resembling a rope. These
anaerobic intestinal ""rope"" parasites differ significantly from other
well-known intestinal parasites. Rope parasites can leave human body with
enemas, and are often mistaken for intestinal lining, feces, or decayed remains
of other parasites. Rope parasites can attach to intestinal walls with suction
bubbles, which later develop into suction heads. Walls of the rope parasites
consist of scale-like cells forming multiple branched channels along the
parasite's length. Rope parasites can move by jet propulsion, passing gas
bubbles through these channels. Currently known antihelminthic methods include
special enemas. Most humans are likely hosting these helminths.

1301.1034,2021-05-07,How many of the digits in a mean of 12.3456789012 are worth reporting?,"  OBJECTIVE. A computer program tells me that a mean value is 12.3456789012,
but how many of these digits are significant (the rest being random junk)?
Should I report: 12.3?, 12.3456?, or even 10 (if only the first digit is
significant)? There are several rules-of-thumb but, surprisingly (given that
the problem is so common in science), none seem to be evidence-based. RESULTS.
Here I show how the significance of a digit in a particular decade of a mean
depends on the standard error of the mean (SEM). I define an index, DM that can
be plotted in graphs. From these a simple evidence-based rule for the number of
significant digits (""sigdigs"") is distilled: the last sigdig in the mean is in
the same decade as the first or second non-zero digit in the SEM. As example,
for mean 34.63 (SEM 25.62), with n = 17, the reported value should be 35 (SEM
26). Digits beyond these contain little or no useful information, and should
not be reported lest they damage your credibility.

1301.2845,2014-10-07,"Development stages of the ""rope"" human intestinal parasite","  This paper describes the five development stages of the rope worm, which
could be human parasite. Rope worms have been discovered as a result of
cleansing enemas. Thousands or people have passed the rope worms from all over
the World. Adult stages live in human gastro-intestinal tract and are
anaerobic. They move inside the body by releasing gas bubbles utilizing jet
propulsion. These worms look like a rope, and can be over a meter long. The
development stages were identified based on their morphology. The fifth stage
looks like a tough string of mucus about a meter long. The fourth stage looks
similar, but the rope worm is shorter and has softer slimier body. The third
stage looks like branched jellyfish. The second stage is viscous snot, or mucus
with visible gas bubbles that act as suction cups. The first stage is slimier
mucus with fewer bubbles, which can reside almost anywhere in the body. Rope
worms have cellular structure, based on optical microscopy, DAPI staining and
DNA analysis, however, the data collected is not sufficient to identify the
specie. Removal methods are also mentioned in the paper.

of a horizontal symmetry used in gauge theories to fit the contents of the

1302.3997,2013-02-19,"Predicting growth and finding biomass production using the general
  growth mechanism","  First, we briefly describe the general growth mechanism, which governs the
growth of living organisms, and its mathematical representation, the growth
equation. Using the growth equation, we compute growth curve for S. cerevisiae
and show that it corresponds to available experimental data. Then, we propose a
new method for finding amount of synthesized biomass without complicated
stoichiometric computations and apply this method to evaluation of biomass
production by S. cerevisiae. We found that obtained results are very close to
values obtained by methods of metabolic flux analysis. Since methods of
metabolic flux analysis require finding produced biomass, which is one of the
most important parameters affecting stoichiometric models, a priori knowledge
of produced biomass can significantly improve methods of metabolic flux
analysis in many aspects, which we also discuss. Besides, based on the general
growth mechanism, we considered evolutionary development of S. cerevisiae and
found that it is a more ancient organism than S. pombe and is apparently its
direct predecessor.

carbonaceous meteorite that fell in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka on
29 December 2012. Contamination is excluded by the circumstance that the
elemental abundances within the structures match closely with those of the

similar to red rain cells that may have contributed to the episode of red rain
that followed within days of the meteorite fall. The new data on fossil diatoms
provide strong evidence to support the theory of cometary panspermia.

1303.6738,2014-03-05,"Parameter Space Compression Underlies Emergent Theories and Predictive
  Models","  We report a similarity between the microscopic parameter dependance of
emergent theories in physics and that of multiparameter models common in other
areas of science. In both cases, predictions are possible despite large
uncertainties in the microscopic parameters because these details are
compressed into just a few governing parameters that are sufficient to describe
relevant observables. We make this commonality explicit by examining parameter
sensitivity in a hopping model of diffusion and a generalized Ising model of
ferromagnetism. We trace the emergence of a smaller effective model to the
development of a hierarchy of parameter importance quantified by the
eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. Strikingly, the same hierarchy
appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science. We conclude
that the emergence of effective continuum and universal theories in physics is
due to the same parameter space hierarchy that underlies predictive modeling in
other areas of science.

1303.6739,2017-06-13,"The ""Wow! signal"" of the terrestrial genetic code","  It has been repeatedly proposed to expand the scope for SETI, and one of the
suggested alternatives to radio is the biological media. Genomic DNA is already
used on Earth to store non-biological information. Though smaller in capacity,
but stronger in noise immunity is the genetic code. The code is a flexible
mapping between codons and amino acids, and this flexibility allows modifying
the code artificially. But once fixed, the code might stay unchanged over
cosmological timescales. Thus, it represents a reliable storage for an
intelligent signature, if that conforms to biological and thermodynamic
requirements. As the actual scenario for the origin of terrestrial life is far
from being settled, the proposal that it might have been seeded intentionally
cannot be ruled out. A statistically strong signal in the genetic code is then
a testable consequence of such scenario. Here we show that the terrestrial code
displays a thorough precision orderliness matching the criteria to be
considered an informational signal. Simple arrangements of the code reveal an
ensemble of arithmetical and ideographical patterns of the same symbolic
language. Accurate and systematic, these underlying patterns appear as a
product of precision logic and nontrivial computing rather than of stochastic
processes. The patterns are profound to the extent that the code mapping itself
is uniquely deduced from their algebraic representation. The signal displays
readily recognizable hallmarks of artificiality. Besides, extraction of the
signal involves logically straightforward but abstract operations, making the
patterns essentially irreducible to any natural origin. Plausible way of
embedding the signal into the code and possible interpretation of its content
are discussed. Overall, while the code is nearly optimized biologically, its
limited capacity is used extremely efficiently to store non-biological
information.

  Emergence is defined as the information a system or process produces.
Self-organization is defined as the opposite of emergence, while complexity is
defined as the balance between emergence and self-organization. Homeostasis
reflects the stability of a system. Autopoiesis is defined as the ratio between
the complexity of a system and the complexity of its environment. The proposed

1304.3747,2013-04-16,The Social Maintenance of Cooperation through Hypocrisy,"  Cooperation is widespread in human societies, but its maintenance at the
group level remains puzzling if individuals benefit from not cooperating.
Explanations of the maintenance of cooperation generally assume that
cooperative and non-cooperative behavior in others can be assessed and copied
accurately. However, humans have a well known capacity to deceive and thus to
manipulate how others assess their behavior. Here, we show that hypocrisy -
claiming to be acting cooperatively while acting selfishly - can maintain
social cooperation because it prevents the spread of selfish behavior. We
demonstrate this effect both theoretically and experimentally. Hypocrisy allows
the cooperative strategy to spread by taking credit for the success of the
non-cooperative strategy.

  agent and high purity ClO2 can be used as a local antiseptic","  Background / Aims ClO2, the so-called ""ideal biocide"", could also be applied
as an antiseptic if it was understood why the solution's rapid killing of
microbes does not cause any harm to humans or to animals. Our aim was to study
both theoretically and experimentally its reaction-diffusion mechanism to find
the source of that selectivity. Methods ClO2 permeation measurements through
protein membranes were performed and the time delay of ClO2 transport due to
reaction and diffusion was determined. To calculate ClO2 penetration depths and
estimate bacterial killing times, approximate solutions of the
reaction-diffusion equation were derived. Additionally, as a preliminary test,
three patients with infected wounds were treated with a 300 ppm high purity
ClO2 solution and the healing process was documented. Results The rate law of
the reaction-diffusion model predicts that the killing time is proportional to
the square of the characteristic size (e.g. diameter) of a body, thus, small
ones will be killed extremely fast. For example, the killing time for a
bacterium is on the order of milliseconds in a 300 ppm ClO2 solution. Thus, the
few minutes of contact time (owing to the volatility of ClO2) is quite enough
to kill all bacteria, but short enough to keep ClO2 penetration into the living
tissues safely below 0.1 mm, minimizing cytotoxic effects. Pictures of
successful wound healings confirm these considerations. Various properties of
ClO2, advantageous for an antiseptic, are also discussed. Most importantly,
bacteria are not able to develop resistance against ClO2 as it reacts with
biological thiols which play a vital role in all living organisms. Conclusion
Selectivity of ClO2 between humans and bacteria is based not on their different
biochemistry, but on their different size. Preliminary clinical results
encourage further research with this promising local antiseptic.

It is unknown how verbal episodic memory is formed and integrated with sensory

Here we present a theory for governing neural activity in the human brain. The
theory describes the mechanisms for building memory traces for entities and
explains how verbal memory is integrated with sensory memory. We infer that a
core function of dreaming is to move charged particles such as calcium ions

the experimental and theoretical exploration of non-trivial quantum phenomena
in biological systems. In this tutorial overview we aim to bring out
fundamental assumptions and questions in the field, identify basic design
principles and develop a key underlying theme -- the dynamics of quantum
dynamical networks in the presence of an environment and the fruitful interplay
that the two may enter. At the hand of three biological phenomena whose
understanding is held to require quantum mechanical processes, namely
excitation and charge transfer in photosynthetic complexes, magneto-reception
in birds and the olfactory sense, we demonstrate that this underlying theme
encompasses them all, thus suggesting its wider relevance as an archetypical
framework for quantum biology.

1307.4704,2013-10-23,Galactic cosmic ray induced radiation dose on terrestrial exoplanets,"  This past decade has seen tremendous advancements in the study of extrasolar
planets. Observations are now made with increasing sophistication from both
ground and space-based instruments, and exoplanets are characterized with
increasing precision. There is a class of particularly interesting exoplanets,
falling in the habitable zone, which is defined as the area around a star where
the planet is capable of supporting liquid water on its surface. Theoretical
calculations also suggest that close-in exoplanets are more likely to have
weaker planetary magnetic fields, especially in case of super earths. Such
exoplanets are subjected to a high flux of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) due to
their weak magnetic moments. GCRs are energetic particles of astrophysical
origin, which strike the planetary atmosphere and produce secondary particles,
including muons, which are highly penetrating. Some of these particles reach
the planetary surface and contribute to the radiation dose. Along with the
magnetic field, another factor governing the radiation dose is the depth of the
planetary atmosphere. The higher the depth of the planetary atmosphere, the
lower the flux of secondary particles will be on the surface. If the secondary
particles are energetic enough, and their flux is sufficiently high, the
radiation from muons can also impact the sub-surface regions, such as in the
case of Mars. If the radiation dose is too high, the chances of sustaining a
long-term biosphere on the planet are very low. We explore the dependence of
the GCR induced radiation dose on the strength of the planetary magnetic field
and its atmospheric depth, finding that the latter is the decisive factor for
the protection of a planetary biosphere.

1307.7882,2017-08-10,"The genetic code, algebra of projection operators and problems of
  inherited biological ensembles","  This article is devoted to applications of projection operators to simulate
phenomenological properties of the molecular-genetic code system. Oblique
projection operators are under consideration, which are connected with matrix
representations of the genetic coding system in forms of the Rademacher and
Hadamard matrices. Evidences are shown that sums of such projectors give
abilities for adequate simulations of ensembles of inherited biological
phenomena including ensembles of biological cycles, morphogenetic ensembles of
phyllotaxis patterns, mirror-symmetric patterns, etc. For such modeling, the
author proposes multidimensional vector spaces, whose subspaces are under a
selective control (or coding) by means of a set of matrix operators on base of
genetic projectors. Development of genetic biomechanics is discussed. The
author proposes and describes special systems of multidimensional numbers under
names united-hypercomplex numbers, which attracted his attention when he
studied genetic systems and genetic matrices. New rules of long nucleotide
sequences are described on the base of the proposed notion of tetra-groups of
equivalent oligonucleotides. Described results can be used for developing
algebraic biology, bio-technical applications and some other fields of science
and technology.

1308.1087,2013-08-07,Designing the statistically optimal drug for cancer therapy,"  Cancer and healthy cells have distinct distributions of molecular properties
and thus respond differently to drugs. Cancer drugs ideally kill cancer cells
while limiting harm to healthy cells. However, the inherent variance among
cells in both cancer and healthy cell populations increases the difficulty of
selective drug action. Here we propose a classification framework based on the
idea that an ideal cancer drug should maximally discriminate between cancer and
healthy cells. We first explore how molecular markers can be used to
discriminate cancer cells from healthy cells on a single cell basis, and then
how the effects of drugs are statistically predicted by these molecular
markers. We then combine these two ideas to show how to optimally match drugs
to tumor cells. We find that expression levels of a handful of genes suffice to
discriminate well between individual cells in cancer and healthy tissue. We
also find that gene expression predicts the efficacy of cancer drugs,
suggesting that the cancer drugs act as classifiers using gene profiles. In
agreement with our first finding, a small number of genes predict drug efficacy
well. Finally, we formulate a framework that defines an optimal drug, and
predicts drug cocktails that may target cancer more accurately than the
individual drugs alone. Conceptualizing cancer drugs as solving a
discrimination problem in the high-dimensional space of molecular markers
promises to inform the design of new cancer drugs and drug cocktails.

  material-informatic basis of biosemiosis","  The sequence of nucleotide bases occurring in an organism's DNA is often
regarded as a codescript for its construction. However, information in a DNA
sequence can only be regarded as a codescript relative to an operational
biochemical machine, which the information constrains in such a way as to
direct the process of construction. In reality, any biochemical machine for
which a DNA codescript is efficacious is itself produced through the mechanical
interpretation of an identical or very similar codescript. In these terms the
origin of life can be described as a bootstrap process involving the
simultaneous accumulation of genetic information and the generation of a
machine that interprets it as instructions for its own construction. This
problem is discussed within the theoretical frameworks of thermodynamics,
informatics and self-reproducing automata, paying special attention to the
physico-chemical origin of genetic coding and the conditions, both
thermodynamic and informatic, which a system must fulfil in order for it to
sustain semiosis. The origin of life is equated with biosemiosis

1308.2277,2015-05-20,An Improved Temporal Formulation of Pupal Transpiration in Glossina,"  The temporal aspect of a model of pupal dehydration is improved upon. The
observed dependence of pupal transpiration on time is attributed to an
alternation between two, essential modes, for which the deposition of a thin,
pupal skin inside the puparium and its subsequent demise are thought to be
responsible. For each mode of transpiration, the results of the Bursell (1958)
investigation into pupal dehydration are used as a rudimentary data set. These
data are generalised to all temperatures and humidities by invoking the
property of multiplicative separability. The problem, then, is that as the
temperature varies with time, so does the metabolism and the developmental
stages to which the model data pertain, must necessarily warp. The
puparial-duration formula of Phelps and Burrows (1969) and Hargrove (2004) is
exploited to facilitate a mapping between the constant-temperature time domain
of the data and that of some, more general case at hand. The resulting,
Glossina morsitans model is extrapolated to other species using their relative
surface areas, their relative protected and unprotected transpiration rates and
their different fourth instar excretions (drawing, to a lesser extent, from the
data of Buxton and Lewis, 1934). In this way the problem of pupal dehydration
is formulated as a series of integrals and the consequent survival can be
predicted. The discovery of a distinct definition for hygrophilic species,
within the formulation, prompts the investigation of the hypothetical effect of
a two-day heat wave on pupae. This leads to the conclusion that the
classification of species as hygrophilic, mesophilic and xerophilic is largely
true only in so much as their third and fourth instars are and, possibly, the
hours shortly before eclosion.
"
1308.2278,2015-10-29,A Model of Teneral Dehydration in Glossina,"  The results of a long-established investigation into teneral transpiration
are used as a rudimentary data set. These data are not complete in that all are
at 25 $^\circ\mathrm{C}$ and the temperature-dependence cannot, therefore be
resolved. An allowance is, nonetheless, made for the outstanding
temperature-dependent data. The data are generalised to all humidities, levels
of activity and, in theory, temperatures, by invoking the property of
multiplicative separability. In this way a formulation, which is a very simple,
first order, ordinary differential equation, is devised. The model is extended
to include a variety of Glossina species by resorting to their relative,
resting water loss rates in dry air. The calculated, total water loss is
converted to the relevant humidity, at 24 $^\circ\mathrm{C}$, that which
produced an equivalent water loss in the pupa, in order to exploit an adaption
of an established survival relationship. The resulting computational model
calculates total, teneral water loss, consequent mortality and adult
recruitment. Surprisingly, the postulated race against time, to feed, applies
more to the mesophilic and xerophilic species, in that increasing order. So
much so that it is reasonable to conclude that, should Glossina brevipalpis
survive the pupal phase, it will almost certainly survive to locate a host,
without there being any significant prospect of death from dehydration. With
the conclusion of this work comes the revelation that the classification of
species as hygrophilic, mesophilic and xerophilic is largely true only in so
much as their third and fourth instars are and, possibly, the hours shortly
before eclosion.

1308.3673,2013-08-19,"Substance Abuse via Legally Prescribed Drugs: The Case of Vicodin in the
  United States","  Vicodin is the most commonly prescribed pain reliever in the United States.
Research indicates that there are two million people who are currently abusing
Vicodin, and the majority of those who abuse Vicodin were initially exposed to
it via prescription. Our goal is to determine the most effective strategies for
reducing the overall population of Vicodin abusers. More specifically, we focus
on whether prevention methods aimed at educating doctors and patients on the
potential for drug abuse or treatment methods implemented after a person abuses
Vicodin will have a greater overall impact. We consider one linear and two
non-linear compartmental models in which medical users of Vicodin can
transition into the abuser compartment or leave the population by no longer
taking the drug. Once Vicodin abusers, people can transition into a treatment
compartment, with the possibility of leaving the population through successful
completion of treatment or of relapsing and re-entering the abusive
compartment. The linear model assumes no social interaction, while both
non-linear models consider interaction. One considers interaction with abusers
affecting the relapse rate, while the other assumes both this and an additional
interaction between the number of abusers and the number of new prescriptions.
Sensitivity analyses are conducted varying the rates of success of these
intervention methods measured by the parameters to determine which strategy has
the greatest impact on controlling the population of Vicodin abusers. From
these models and analyses, we determine that manipulating parameters tied to
prevention measures has a greater impact on reducing the population of abusers
than manipulating parameters associated with treatment. We also note that
increasing the rate at which abusers seek treatment affects the population of
abusers more than the success rate of treatment itself.

  Crazy Ant Colonies","  This project is motivated by the costs related with the documented risks of
the introduction of non-native invasive species of plants, animals, or
pathogens associated with travel and international trade. Such invasive species
often have no natural enemies in their new regions. The spatiotemporal dynamics
related to the invasion/spread of Nylanderia fulva, commonly known as the
Rasberry crazy ant, are explored via the use of models that focus on the
reproduction of ant colonies. A Cellular Automaton (CA) simulates the spatially
explicit spread of ants on a grid. The impact of local spatial correlations on
the dynamics of invasion is investigated numerically and analytically with the
aid of a Mean Field (MF) model and a Pair Approximation (PA) model, the latter
of which accounts for adjacent cell level efects. The PA model approach
considers the limited mobility range of N. fulva, that is, the grid cell
dynamics are not strongly in uenced by non-adjacent cells. The model determines
the rate of growth of colonies of N. fulva under distinct cell spatial
architecture. Numerical results and qualitative conclusions on the spread and
control of this invasive ant species are discussed.

1309.1076,2013-09-06,"Physics of Rheologically-Enhanced Propulsion: Different Strokes in
  Generalized Stokes","  Shear-thinning is an important rheological property of many biological
fluids, such as mucus, whereby the apparent viscosity of the fluid decreases
with shear. Certain microscopic swimmers have been shown to progress more
rapidly through shear-thinning fluids, but is this behavior generic to all
microscopic swimmers, and what are the physics through which shear-thinning
rheology affects a swimmer's propulsion? We examine swimmers employing
prescribed stroke kinematics in two-dimensional, inertialess Carreau fluid:
shear-thinning ""Generalized Stokes"" flow. Swimmers are modeled, using the
method of femlets, by a set of immersed, regularized forces. The equations
governing the fluid dynamics are then discretized over a body-fitted mesh and
solved with the finite element method. We analyze the locomotion of three
distinct classes of microswimmer: (1) conceptual swimmers comprising sliding
spheres employing both one- and two-dimensional strokes, (2) slip-velocity
envelope models of ciliates commonly referred to as ""squirmers"" and (3)
monoflagellate pushers, such as sperm. We find that morphologically identical
swimmers with different strokes may swim either faster or slower in
shear-thinning fluids than in Newtonian fluids. We explain this kinematic
sensitivity by considering differences in the viscosity of the fluid
surrounding propulsive and payload elements of the swimmer, and using this
insight suggest two reciprocal sliding sphere swimmers which violate Purcell's
Scallop theorem in shear-thinning fluids. We also show that an increased flow
decay rate arising from shear-thinning rheology is associated with a reduction
in the swimming speed of slip-velocity squirmers. For sperm-like swimmers, a
gradient of thick to thin fluid along the flagellum alters the force it exerts
upon the fluid, flattening trajectories and increasing instantaneous swimming
speed.

1309.1303,2013-09-06,Symmetry breaking cilia-driven flow in the zebrafish embryo,"  Fluid mechanics plays a vital role in early vertebrate embryo development, an
example being the establishment of left-right asymmetry. Following the
dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior axes, the left-right axis is the last to
be established; in several species it has been shown that an important process
involved with this is the production of a left-right asymmetric flow driven by
'whirling' cilia. It has previously been established in experimental and
mathematical models of the mouse ventral node that the combination of a
consistent rotational direction and posterior tilt creates left-right
asymmetric flow. The zebrafish organising structure, Kupffer's vesicle, has a
more complex internal arrangement of cilia than the mouse ventral node;
experimental studies show the flow exhibits an anticlockwise rotational motion
when viewing the embryo from the dorsal roof, looking in the ventral direction.
Reports of the arrangement and configuration of cilia suggest two possible
mechanisms for the generation of this flow from existing axis information: (1)
posterior tilt combined with increased cilia density on the dorsal roof, and
(2) dorsal tilt of 'equatorial' cilia. We develop a mathematical model of
symmetry breaking cilia-driven flow in Kupffer's vesicle using the regularized
Stokeslet boundary element method. Computations of the flow produced by tilted
whirling cilia in an enclosed domain suggest that a possible mechanism capable
of producing the flow field with qualitative and quantitative features closest
to those observed experimentally is a combination of posteriorly tilted roof
and floor cilia, and dorsally tilted equatorial cilia.

1309.2684,2018-10-17,"Liquid general anesthetics lower critical temperatures in plasma
  membrane vesicles","  A large and diverse array of small hydrophobic molecules induce general
anesthesia. Their efficacy as anesthetics has been shown to correlate both with
their affinity for a hydrophobic environment and with their potency in
inhibiting certain ligand gated ion channels. Here we explore the effects that
n-alcohols and other liquid anesthetics have on the two-dimensional miscibility
critical point observed in cell derived giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs).
We show that anesthetics depress the critical temperature (Tc) of these GPMVs
without strongly altering the ratio of the two liquid phases found below Tc.
The magnitude of this affect is consistent across n-alcohols when their
concentration is rescaled by the median anesthetic concentration (AC50) for
tadpole anesthesia, but not when plotted against the overall concentration in
solution. At AC50 we see a 4{\deg}C downward shift in Tc, much larger than is
typically seen in the main chain transition at these anesthetic concentrations.
GPMV miscibility critical temperatures are also lowered to a similar extent by
propofol, phenylethanol, and isopropanol when added at anesthetic
concentrations, but not by tetradecanol or 2,6 diterbutylphenol, two structural
analogs of general anesthetics that are hydrophobic but have no anesthetic
potency. We propose that liquid general anesthetics provide an experimental
tool for lowering critical temperatures in plasma membranes of intact cells,
which we predict will reduce lipid-mediated heterogeneity in a way that is
complimentary to increasing or decreasing cholesterol. Also, several possible
implications of our results are discussed in the context of current models of
anesthetic action on ligand gated ion channels.

  Cells","  A quantum model on the chemically and physically induced pluripotency in stem
cells is proposed. Based on the conformational Hamiltonian and the idea of slow
variables (molecular torsions) slaving fast ones the conversion from the
differentiate state to pluripotent state is defined as the quantum transition
between conformational states. The transitional rate is calculated and an
analytical form for the rate formulas is deduced. Then the dependence of the
rate on the number of torsion angles of the gene and the magnitude of the rate
can be estimated by comparison with protein folding. The reaction equations of
the conformational change of the pluripotency genes in chemical reprogramming
are given. The characteristic time of the chemical reprogramming is calculated
and the result is consistent with experiments. The dependence of the transition
rate on physical factors such as temperature, PH value and the volume and shape
of the coherent domain is analyzed from the rate equation. It is suggested that
by decreasing the coherence degree of some pluripotency genes a more effective
approach to the physically induced pluripotency can be made.

Although the observed features in distributions of element lengths can be
equally well fitted by the different statistical approximations, the
interpretation of observed regularities may strongly depend on the chosen
scheme. We discuss the possible evolution scenarios and describe the main
characteristics obtained with different distributions. The expression for the
assessment of levels in hierarchical chromatin folding is derived and the
quantitative measure of genome architecture inhomogeneity is suggested. This
theory provides the ground for the regular statistical study of genome

  duration","  Many urological studies rely upon animal models such as rats and pigs whose
urination physics and correlation to humans are poorly understood. Here we
elucidate the hydrodynamics of urination across five orders of magnitude in
animal mass. Using high-speed videography and flow rate measurement at Zoo
Atlanta, we discover the ""Law of Urination,"" which states animals empty their
bladders over nearly constant duration of average 21 seconds (standard
deviation 13 seconds). This feat is made possible by larger animals having
longer urethras, thus higher gravitational force and flow speed. Smaller
mammals are challenged during urination due to high viscous and surface tension
forces that limit their urine to single drops. Our findings reveal the urethra
constitutes as a flow enhancing device, enabling the urinary system to be
scaled up without compromising its function. This study may help in the
diagnosis of urinary problems in animals and in inspiring the design of
scalable hydrodynamic systems based on those in nature.

1310.4946,2014-02-17,"Local dynamic stability of treadmill walking: intrasession and
  week-to-week repeatability","  Repetitive falls degrade the quality of life of elderly people and of
patients suffering of various neurological disorders. In order to prevent falls
while walking, one should rely on relevant early indicators of impaired dynamic
balance. The local dynamic stability (LDS) represents the sensitivity of gait
to small perturbations: divergence exponents (maximal Lyapunov exponents)
assess how fast a dynamical system diverges from neighbor points. Although
numerous findings attest the validity of LDS as a fall risk index, reliability
results are still sparse. The present study explores the intrasession and
intersession repeatability of gait LDS using intraclass correlation
coefficients (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM). Ninety-five healthy
individuals performed 5min. treadmill walking in two sessions separated by 9
days. Trunk acceleration was measured with a 3D accelerometer. Three time
scales were used to estimate LDS: over 4 to 10 strides ({\lambda}4-10), over
one stride ({\lambda}1) and over one step ({\lambda}0.5). The intrasession
repeatability was assessed from three repetitions of either 35 strides or 70
strides taken within the 5min tests. The intersession repeatability compared
the two sessions, which totalized 210 strides. The intrasession ICCs
(70-strides estimates/35-strides estimates) were 0.52/0.18 for {\lambda}4-10
and 0.84/0.77 for {\lambda}1 and {\lambda}0.5. The intersession ICCs were
around 0.60. The SEM results revealed that {\lambda}0.5 measured in
medio-lateral direction exhibited the best reliability, sufficient to detect
moderate changes at individual level (20%). However, due to the low
intersession repeatability, one should average several measurements taken on
different days in order to better approximate the true LDS.

insights into both structure and function. It is most common to study community
structure, but numerous other types of mesoscale structures also exist. In this
paper, we examine core-periphery structures based on both density and
transport. In such structures, core network components are well-connected both
among themselves and to peripheral components, which are not well-connected to
anything. We examine core-periphery structures in a wide range of examples of
transportation, social, and financial networks---including road networks in
large urban areas, a rabbit warren, a dolphin social network, a European
interbank network, and a migration network between counties in the United
States. We illustrate that a recently developed transport-based notion of node
coreness is very useful for characterizing transportation networks. We also
generalize this notion to examine core versus peripheral edges, and we show
that the resulting diagnostic is also useful for transportation networks. To
examine the properties of transportation networks further, we develop a family
of generative models of roadlike networks. We illustrate the effect of the
dimensionality of the embedding space on transportation networks, and we
demonstrate that the correlations between different measures of coreness can be
very different for different types of networks.

1310.8619,2013-11-01,"The age specific incidence anomaly suggests that cancers originate
  during development","  Cancers are caused by the accumulation of genetic alterations. Since this
accumulation takes time, the incidence of most cancers is thought to increase
exponentially with age. However, careful measurements of the age-specific
incidence shows that the specific incidence for many forms of cancer rises with
age to a maximum, then decreases. This decrease in the age-specific incidence
with age is an anomaly. Understanding this anomaly should lead to a better
understanding of how tumors develop and grow. Here I derive the shape of the
age-specific incidence, showing that it should follow the shape of a Weibull
distribution. Measurements indicate that the age-specific incidence for colon
cancer does indeed follow a Weibull distribution. This analysis leads to the
interpretation that for colon cancer two sub-populations exist in the general
population: a susceptible population and an immune population. Colon tumors
will only occur in the susceptible population. This analysis is consistent with
the developmental origins of disease hypothesis and generalizable to many other
common forms of cancer.

various observed phenomena and mathematical relationships in the field of
molecular biology. By modeling each cell in eukaryotic organisms as a processor
having a unique set of allowed states, represented by a specific DNA sequence,
we demonstrate a method by which gene expression can be regulated. As the
theory is developed, we suggest reasons for the complementary, quaternary

elements is suggested, as is a role for the abundance of noncoding DNA, along
with a clearly-defined method by which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's)
may alter gene expression. The effect of various errors is considered. Finally,
a mechanism for inter-processor communication is proposed to explain cell-cell
recognition processes, which leads to an elucidation of a possible pathway by
which nonmutagenic carcinogenic agents may act.

disturbances (GMD) has the ability to provide explanations for this observed
trend. In this commentary, we showed that there is a significant correlation
among alterations in GMD with changes in MS incidence and explained how
researchers can use GMD hypothesis to evaluate such relations. Moreover, we
clarified why we need a revision in the method of reporting MS incidence data
to find actual environmental factor of MS.

about existence of differential polyteny of chromosomes and excess chromatin
diminution during the first stages of embryogenesis. It has been concluded that
available data provide the genetic proof that chromatin diminution is one of
the mechanisms underlying the origin of polymorphism in sugar beet

  Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","  The aim of this paper is to study the (clinical) time-series data of three
diseases with complex dynamics: Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. For this purpose, first all of the time series
data are embedded in a vector space of suitable dimension and then the
correlation dimension of the above mentioned diseases is estimated. The results
are also compared with healthy control subjects. At the next step, existence of
chaos in these diseases is investigated by means of the so-called 0-1 test. The
simulations show that none of the above mentioned diseases are chaotic.

1401.2211,2014-01-13,Possibilities of life around Alpha Centauri B,"  We make a preliminary assessment on the habitability of potential rocky
exoplanets around Alpha Centauri B. We use several indexes: the Earth
Similarity Index, a mathematical model for photosynthesis, and a biological
productivity model. Considering the atmospheres of the exoplanets similar to
current Earth's atmosphere, we find consistent predictions of both the Earth
Similarity Index and the biological productivity model. The mathematical model
for photosynthesis clearly failed because does not consider the temperature
explicitly. For the case of Alpha Centauri B, several simulation runs give 11
planets in the habitable zone. Applying to them above mentioned indexes, we
select the five exoplanets more prone for photosynthetic life; showing that two
of them in principle have better conditions than Earth for this kind of life.

1401.3203,2014-04-16,Foundations of biology,"  It is often stated that there are no laws in biology, where everything is
contingent and could have been otherwise, being solely the result of historical
accidents. Furthermore, the customary introduction of fundamental biological
entities such as individual organisms, cells, genes, catalysts and motors
remains largely descriptive; constructive approaches involving deductive
reasoning appear, in comparison, almost absent. As a consequence, both the
logical content and principles of biology need to be reconsidered. The present
article describes an inquiry into the foundations of biology. The foundations
of biology are built in terms of elements, logic and principles, using both the
language and the general methods employed in other disciplines. This approach
assumes the existence of a certain unity of human knowledge that transcends
discipline boundaries. Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason is revised
through the introduction of the complementary concepts of symmetry and
asymmetry and of necessity and contingency. This is used to explain how these
four concepts are involved in the elaboration of theories or laws of nature.
Four fundamental theories of biology are then identified: cell theory, Darwin's
theory of natural selection, an informational theory of life (which includes
Mendel's theory of inheritance) and a physico-chemical theory of life. Atomism
and deductive reasoning are shown to enter into the elaboration of the concepts
of natural selection, individual living organisms, cells and their
reproduction, genes as well as catalysts and motors. This work contributes to
clarify the philosophical and logical structure of biology and its major
theories. This should ultimately lead to a better understanding of the origin
of life, of system and synthetic biology, and of artificial life.

called habitability zone. Results suggest significant viability for primary
biological productivity, provided living organisms have evolved to reach the
ability of using infrared light for photosynthesis.

increase can arise from natural selection in biological evolution. We show that
this effect can be demonstrated in very simple toy computer simulations of
evolution in an entropy increasing or decreasing environment.

1401.6430,2014-01-27,Responding to the AIDS epidemic in Angola,"  The epidemic of HIV in Angola started later and stabilized at lower levels
than elsewhere in southern Africa. With a relatively small population and a
high GDP, Angola is in a good position to intervene decisively to control HIV.
The effectiveness, availability and affordability of anti-retroviral therapy
(ART) make it possible to contemplate ending the epidemic of HIV/AIDS in
Angola. We consider what would have happened without ART, the No ART
counterfactual, the impact on the epidemic if the current roll-out of ART is
maintained, the Current Programme, the impact if coverage is rapidly increased
to reach 90% of people with CD4+ cell counts below 350/micro-litre by 2015 and
HIV-positive pregnant women are all offered ART for life (Option B+), the
Accelerated Programme, and what might be possible under the 2013 guidelines
from the World Health Organization, starting in 2015 and reaching full coverage
of ART by 2018, the Expanded Programme.If Angola is to reach the 2015 targets
in the Presidents Acceleration Plan testing services will need to be expanded.
A regular, uninterrupted supply of drugs will have to be assured. Existing
health staff will need to be strengthened. Community health workers will need
to be mobilized and trained to encourage people to be tested and accept
treatment, to monitor progress and to support people on treatment; this in turn
will help to reduce stigma and discrimination, loss to follow up of people
diagnosed with HIV, and improve adherence for those on treatment. Effective
monitoring and evaluation systems will have to be in place and data collection
will have to be extended and improved to support the development of reliable
estimates of the current and future state of the epidemic, the success of the
programme, levels of viral load suppression for those on ART and the incidence
of infection.

1402.6910,2014-07-22,"Technological integration and hyper-connectivity: Tools for promoting
  extreme human lifespans","  Artificial, neurobiological, and social networks are three distinct complex
adaptive systems (CAS), each containing discrete processing units (nodes,
neurons, and humans respectively). Despite the apparent differences, these
three networks are bound by common underlying principles which describe the
behaviour of the system in terms of the connections of its components, and its
emergent properties. The longevity (long-term retention and functionality) of
the components of each of these systems is also defined by common principles.
Here, I will examine some properties of the longevity and function of the
components of artificial and neurobiological systems, and generalise these to
the longevity and function of the components of social CAS. In other words, I
will show that principles governing the long-term functionality of computer
nodes and of neurons, may be extrapolated to the study of the long-term
functionality of humans (or more precisely, of the noemes, an abstract
combination of existence and digital fame). The study of these phenomena can
provide useful insights regarding practical ways that can be used in order to
maximize human longevity. The basic law governing these behaviours is the Law
of Requisite Usefulness, which states that the length of retention of an agent
within a CAS is proportional to the contribution of the agent to the overall
adaptability of the system. Key Words: Complex Adaptive Systems,

1403.3256,2014-03-14,"Parkinson disease is a TH17 dominant autoimmune disorder against
  accumulated alpha-synuclein","  Parkinson disease is a very common neurodegenerative disorder. Patients
usually undergo destruction of substantia nigra to develop typical symptoms
such as resting tremor, hypokinesia, and rigidity. However, the exact mechanism
of Parkinson disease is still unknown, so it is called idiopathic Parkinsonism.
According to my microarray analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes and
substantia nigra brain tissue, I propose that Parkinson disease is actually a
TH17 dominant autoimmune disease. Based on the microarray data in substantia
nigra, HSP40, HSP70, HSP90, HSP27, HSP105, TLR5, TLR7, CEBPB, CEBPG, FOS, and
caspase1 are significantly up-regulated. In peripheral leukocytes, NFKB1A,
CEBPD, FOS, retinoic receptor alpha, suppressor of IKK epsilon, S100A11, G-CSF,
MMP9, IL-1 receptor, IL-8 receptor, TNF receptor, caspase8, c1q receptor,

immune related genes are also up-regulated including ILF2, CD22, CD3E, BLNK,
ILF3, TCR alpha, TCR zeta, TCR delta, LAT, ITK, Ly9, and BANK1. The autoantigen
is mainly alpha-synuclein. After knowing the exact disease pathophysiology, we
can develop better drugs to prevent or control the detrimental disorder.

  Analysis of the association between the environment and health has become a
major public health concern, as shown by the development of two national
environmental health plans. For such an analysis, policy-makers need tools to
identify the geographic areas where overexposure to toxic agents may be
observed. The objective of the SIGFRIED 1 project is to build a work station
for spatial modeling of the exposure of the French population to chemical
substances and for identifying the determinants of this exposure. Probabilistic
multimedia modeling is used to assess exposure. The epistemological problems
associated with the absence of data are overcome by the implementation of tools
that apply spatial analysis techniques. An example is furnished for the region
of Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Picardie, for cadmium, nickel and lead exposure. The
calculation of exposure is performed for duration of 70 years on the basis of
data collected around 2004 fora grid of squares 1 km in length. For example,
for Nord-Pas-de-Calais, the indicators allow us to define two areas for cadmium
and three for lead. They are linked to the region's industrial history: mining
basin, metallurgy activities, and the Lille metropolitan area. The contribution
of various exposure pathways varied substantially from one pollutant to
another. The exposure maps thus obtained allow us to identify the geographic
area where environmental studies must be conducted in priority. The GIS thus
constructed is the foundation of a workstation where source emission data,
environmental exposure measurements, and finally health and socioeconomic
measurements can be combined.

1403.6365,2014-12-16,"Stem Cell Transplantation As A Dynamical System: Are Clinical Outcomes
  Deterministic?","  Outcomes in stem cell transplantation (SCT) are modeled using probability
theory. However the clinical course following SCT appears to demonstrate many
characteristics of dynamical systems, especially when outcomes are considered
in the context of immune reconstitution. Dynamical systems tend to evolve over
time according to mathematically determined rules. Characteristically, the
future states of the system are predicated on the states preceding them, and
there is sensitivity to initial conditions. In SCT, the interaction between
donor T cells and the recipient may be considered as such a system in which,
graft source, conditioning and early immunosuppression profoundly influence
immune reconstitution over time. This eventually determines clinical outcomes,
either the emergence of tolerance or the development of graft versus host
disease. In this paper parallels between SCT and dynamical systems are explored
and a conceptual framework for developing mathematical models to understand
disparate transplant outcomes is proposed.

1403.8135,2014-04-08,"Cybernetic Principles of Aging and Rejuvenation: the
  buffering-challenging strategy for life extension","  Aging is analyzed as the spontaneous loss of adaptivity and increase in
fragility that characterizes dynamic systems. Cybernetics defines the general
regulatory mechanisms that a system can use to prevent or repair the damage
produced by disturbances. According to the law of requisite variety,
disturbances can be held in check by maximizing buffering capacity, range of
compensatory actions, and knowledge about which action to apply to which
disturbance. This suggests a general strategy for rejuvenating the organism by
increasing its capabilities of adaptation. Buffering can be optimized by
providing sufficient rest together with plenty of nutrients: amino acids,
antioxidants, methyl donors, vitamins, minerals, etc. Knowledge and the range
of action can be extended by subjecting the organism to an as large as possible
variety of challenges. These challenges are ideally brief so as not to deplete
resources and produce irreversible damage. However, they should be sufficiently
intense and unpredictable to induce an overshoot in the mobilization of
resources for damage repair, and to stimulate the organism to build stronger
capabilities for tackling future challenges. This allows them to override the
trade-offs and limitations that evolution has built into the organism's repair
processes in order to conserve potentially scarce resources. Such acute,
""hormetic"" stressors strengthen the organism in part via the ""order from noise""
mechanism that destroys dysfunctional structures by subjecting them to strong,
random variations. They include heat and cold, physical exertion, exposure,
stretching, vibration, fasting, food toxins, micro-organisms, environmental
enrichment and psychological challenges.

1404.0701,2014-04-04,"A probabilistic model to describe the dual phenomena of biochemical
  pathway damage and biochemical pathway repair","  Biochemical pathways emerge from a series of Brownian collisions between
various types of biological macromolecules within separate cellular
compartments and in highly viscous cytosol. Functioning of biochemical networks
suggests that such serendipitous collisions, as a whole, result into a perfect
synchronous order. Nonetheless, owing to the very nature of Brownian
collisions, a small yet non-trivial probability can always be associated with
the events when such synchronizations fail to emerge consistently; which
account for a damage of a biochemical pathway. The repair mechanism of the
system then attempts to minimize the damage, in the pursuit to bring restore
the appropriate level of synchronization between reactant concentrations.
Present work presents a predictive probabilistic model that describes the
various facets of this complicated and coupled process(damaging and repairing).
By describing the cytosolic reality of Brownian collisions with
Chapman-Kolmogorov equations, the model presents analytical answers to the
questions, with what probability a fragment of any pathway may suffer damage
within an arbitrary interval of time? and with what probability the damage to a
pathway can be repaired within any arbitrary interval of time?

with worlds as instants of time, as an unified framework to encode both
biological systems and temporal properties of their dynamic behaviour. To
illustrate our methodology, we consider a model of the P53/Mdm2 DNA-damage
repair mechanism. We prove several properties that are important for such a
model to satisfy and serve to illustrate the promise of our approach. We
formalize the proofs of these properties in the Coq Proof Assistant, with the

1406.0094,2014-06-03,"Conception of Biologic System: Basis Functional Elements and Metric
  Properties","  A notion of biologic system or just a system implies a functional wholeness
of comprising system components. Positive and negative feedback are the
examples of how the idea to unite anatomical elements in the whole functional
structure was successfully used in practice to explain regulatory mechanisms in
biology and medicine. There are numerous examples of functional and metabolic
pathways which are not regulated by feedback loops and have a structure of
reciprocal relationships. Expressed in the matrix form positive feedback,
negative feedback, and reciprocal links represent three basis elements of a Lie
algebra sl(2,R)of a special linear group SL(2,R). It is proposed that the
mathematical group structure can be realized through the three regulatory
elements playing a role of a functional basis of biologic systems. The
structure of the basis elements endows the space of biological variables with
indefinite metric. Metric structure resembles Minkowski's space-time (+, -, -)
making the carrier spaces of biologic variables and the space of
transformations inhomogeneous. It endows biologic systems with a rich
functional structure, giving the regulatory elements special differentiating
features to form steady autonomous subsystems reducible to one-dimensional
components.

1406.2730,2014-06-12,The Natural Science Underlying Big History,"  Nature's many varied complex systems (including galaxies, stars, planets,
life, and society) are islands of order within the increasingly disordered
universe. All organized systems are subject to physical, biological or cultural
evolution, which together comprise the grander interdisciplinary subject of
cosmic evolution. This is global history greatly extended, big history with a
scientific basis, and natural history broadly portrayed across 14 billion years
of time. Such evolution writ large has significant potential to unify the
natural sciences into a holistic understanding of who we are and whence we
came. No new science (beyond frontier, non-equilibrium thermodynamics) is
needed to describe cosmic evolution's major milestones at a deep and empirical
level. Quantitative models and experimental tests imply that a remarkable
simplicity underlies the emergence and growth of complexity for a wide spectrum
of known and diverse systems. In particular, energy rate density is an
objective metric suitable to gauge relative degrees of complexity along a
hierarchy of widely assorted systems observed throughout the material universe.

1406.3016,2014-06-13,LEDs for Energy Efficient Greenhouse Lighting,"  Light energy is an important factor for plant growth. In regions where the
natural light source, i.e. solar radiation, is not sufficient for growth
optimization, additional light sources are being used. Traditional light
sources such as high pressure sodium lamps and other metal halide lamps are not
very efficient and generate high radiant heat. Therefore, new sustainable
solutions should be developed for energy efficient greenhouse lighting. Recent
developments in the field of light source technologies have opened up new
perspectives for sustainable and highly efficient light sources in the form of
light-emitting diodes, i.e. LEDs, for greenhouse lighting. This review focuses
on the potential of LEDs to replace traditional light sources in the
greenhouse. In a comparative economic analysis of traditional vs. LED lighting,
we show that the introduction of LEDs allows reduction of the production cost
of vegetables in the long-run of several years, due to the high energy
efficiency, low maintenance cost and longevity of LEDs. In order to evaluate
LEDs as a true alternative to current lighting sources, species specific plant
response to different wavelengths is discussed in a comparative study. However,
more detailed scientific studies are necessary to understand the effect of
different LED spectra on plants physiology. Technical innovations are required
to design and realize an energy efficient light source with a spectrum tailored
for optimal plant growth in specific plant species.

1406.4474,2015-10-29,"A Set of Discrete Formulae for the Performance of a Tsetse Population
  During Aerial Spraying","  A set of discrete formulae that calculates the hypothetical impact of aerial
spraying on a tsetse population is derived and the work is thought to be novel.
Both the original population and the subsequent generations which survive the
aerial spraying, may ultimately be thought of as deriving from two, distinct
sources. These origins are, however, neither distinct, nor relevant by the
third generation. It is for this reason that the female population is
considered to be composed of the following four categories for the purposes of
derivation: Original flies which existed as such at the commencement of
spraying; original pupae which existed as such at the commencement of spraying;
the immediate descendants of both the aforementioned categories, during
spraying; third and higher generation descendants. In theory, the latter
category is a recurrence relation. In practice, the third generation's pupal
stage has hardly come into existence, even by the end of a completed operation.
Implicit in the formulae is the assumption of one, temperature-dependent
mortality rate for the entire pupal stage, a second for the period between
eclosion and ovulation and yet a third for the entire, adult life-span. Gravid
female resistance to the insecticide is assumed to be inconsequential. A
further assumption of the formulae is that at least one male is always
available (degree of sterility variable).

taken as a key parameter. A mathematical relation describing the condensation
of the three basic subunits a nucleobase, a ribose and a phosphate group, to
form a ribonucleotide, is first obtained from this parameter. Next, the use of
the latter and Euler totient function is shown to lead to the atom number
content of the 64 codons and also to Rakocevic pattern. Finally, selected
finite sums of Fibonacci numbers are shown to lead to the nucleon number
content of the amino acids in various degeneracy patterns, and also to the
multiplet structure of the 20 amino acids as well as to the degeneracy.

1406.6328,2014-06-25,Practical Applications of Cosmology to Human Society,"  Complex systems throughout Nature display structures and functions that are
built and maintained, at least in part, by optimal energies flowing through

which systems are starved and above which systems are destroyed. Cosmic
evolution, as a physical cosmology that notably includes life, is rich in
empirical findings about many varied systems that can potentially help assess
global problems facing us here on Earth. Despite its grand and ambitious
objective to unify theoretical understanding of all known complex systems from
big bang to humankind, cosmic evolution does have useful, practical
applications from which humanity could benefit. Cosmic evolution's emphasis on
quantitative data analyses might well inform our attitudes toward several
serious issues now challenging 21st-century society, including global warming,
smart machines, world economics, and cancer research. This paper comprises one
physicist's conjectures about each of these applied topics, suggesting how
energy-flow modeling can guide our search for viable solutions to real-world
predicaments confronting civilization today.

1406.6604,2014-06-26,"The model of circular and longitudinal smooth muscle motions in the
  motility of intestinal segment","  Coordination in circular and longitudinal muscle motions are of crucial
importance in the motor function of gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Intestinal
wall motions depend on myogenic-active properties of smooth muscles layers of
intestinal wall, which is the ability to create active contractile forces in
response to distension. Considering the stress in the circular and longitudinal
smooth muscles as a sum of passive, depending on muscle deformations, and
active, depending on muscle tone, components, and also assuming that the change
in the muscle tone depends on the current stress-strain condition, the system
of four ordinary differential equations (ODE) is obtained, which describes
filling-emptying cycle of intestinal segment as a process of coordinated
activities of circular and longitudinal muscles of intestinal wall. A general
approach in formulating the modelling conditions is based on the previously
described model restricted to the circularly distensible reservoir of constant
length. Obtained results illustrate the character of coordinated activities of
two orthogonal muscle layers, which are alternating phases of reciprocally and
uniformly changing modalities such as stretching of the wall and muscle tone.
The results also contribute to the existing understanding of the roles of
Auerbach's and Meisner's intermuscular and submucous neural plexuses in
regulations of autonomous intestinal motility, as well as clarify functional
mechanisms of the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) in triggering of smooth
muscle contractions.

1407.4689,2014-07-18,Biological Electric Fields and Rate Equations for Biophotons,"  Ultraweak bioluminescence - the emission of biophotons - remains an
experimentally well-established, but theoretically poorly understood
phenomenon. This paper presents several related investigations into the
physical process of both spontaneous biophoton emission and delayed
luminescence. Since light intensities depend upon the modulus squared of their
corresponding electric fields we first make some general estimates about the
inherent electric fields within various biological systems. Since photon
emission from living matter following an initial excitation (""delayed
luminescence"") typically does not follow a simple exponential decay law after
excitation we discuss such non-exponential decays from a general theoretical
perspective and argue that they are often to be expected and why. We then
discuss the dynamics behind some nonlinear rate equations, connecting them both
to biological growth rates and biophoton emission rates, noting a possible
connection with cancer. We then return to non-exponential decay laws seen for
delayed luminescence in an experimental context and again note a possible
connection with cancer.

1407.4706,2014-07-18,An Integration of Integrated Information Theory with Fundamental Physics,"  To truly eliminate Cartesian ghosts from the science of consciousness, we
must describe consciousness as an aspect of the physical. Integrated
Information Theory states that consciousness arises from intrinsic information
generated by dynamical systems; however existing formulations of this theory
are not applicable to standard models of fundamental physical entities. Modern
physics has shown that fields are fundamental entities, and in particular that
the electromagnetic field is fundamental. Here I hypothesize that consciousness
arises from information intrinsic to fundamental fields. This hypothesis unites
fundamental physics with what we know empirically about the neuroscience
underlying consciousness, and it bypasses the need to consider quantum effects.

1407.6030,2014-07-24,"Information -sharing, adaptive epigenetics and human longevity","  Emerging empirical and theoretical thinking about human aging places
considerable value upon the role of the environment as a major factor which can
promote prolonged healthy longevity. Our contemporary, information-rich
environment is taken to mean not merely the actual physical surroundings of a
person but it is also considered in a more abstract sense, to denote cultural,
societal and technological influences. Our modern environment is far from being
static or stable. In fact, it is continually changing in an exponential manner,
necessitating constant adaptive responses on behalf of our developmental and
evolutionary mechanisms. In this paper, I attempt to describe how a continual,
balanced and meaningful exposure to a stimulating environment, including
exposure to information-that-requires-action (but NOT trivial information), has
direct or indirect repercussions on epigenetic mechanisms which may then act to
prolong healthy longevity. Information gained from our environment acts as a
hormetic stimulus which up-regulates biological responses and feedback loops,
eventually leading to improved repair of age-related damage. The consequence of
this biological information-processing mechanism may influence resource
allocation and redress the imbalance between somatic cell versus germ-line cell
repairs. This can eventually have evolutionary consequences resulting in the
drastic reduction of age-related disease and degeneration.

1407.7622,2021-06-01,Starvation of Cancer via Induced Ketogenesis and Severe Hypoglycemia,"  Neoplasms are highly dependent on glucose as their substrate for energy
production and are generally not able to catabolize other fuel sources such as
ketones and fatty acids. Thus, removing access to glucose has the potential to
starve cancer cells and induce apoptosis. Unfortunately, other body tissues are
also dependent on glucose for energy under normal conditions. However, in human
starvation (or in the setting of diet-induced ketogenesis), the body
""keto-adapts"" and glucose requirements of most tissues drop to almost nil.
Exceptions include the central nervous system (CNS) and various other tissues
which have a small but obligatory requirement of glucose. Our hypothesized
treatment takes keto-adaptation as a prerequisite. We then propose the
induction of severe hypoglycemia by depressing gluconeogenesis while
administering glucose to the brain. Although severe hypoglycemia normally
produces adverse effects such as seizure and coma, it is relatively safe
following ketoadaptation. We hypothesize that our therapeutic hypoglycemia
treatment has potential to rapidly induce tumor cell necrosis.

1408.1385,2014-08-28,Ontogeny of aerial righting and wing flapping in juvenile birds,"  Mechanisms of aerial righting in juvenile Chukar Partridge (Alectoris chukar)
were studied from hatching through 14 days post hatching (dph). Asymmetric
movements of the wings were used from 1 to 8 dph to effect progressively more
successful righting behaviour via body roll. Following 8 dph, wing motions
transitioned to bilaterally symmetric flapping that yielded aerial righting via
nose down pitch, along with substantial increases in vertical force production
during descent. Ontogenetically, the use of such wing motions to effect aerial
righting precedes both symmetric flapping and a previously documented behaviour
in chukar (i.e., wing assisted incline running) hypothesized to be relevant to
incipient flight evolution in birds. These findings highlight the importance of
asymmetric wing activation and controlled aerial manoeuvres during bird
development, and are potentially relevant to understanding the origins of avian
flight.

1408.7076,2014-09-01,"Accounting for the 'network' in the Natura 2000 network: A response to
  Hochkirch et al. 2013","  Worldwide, we are experiencing an unprecedented, accelerated loss of
biodiversity triggered by a bundle of anthropogenic threats such as habitat
destruction, environmental pollution and climate change. Despite all efforts of
the European biodiversity conservation policy, initiated 20 years ago by the
Habitats Directive that provided the legal basis for establishing the Natura
2000 network, the goal to halt the decline of biodiversity in Europe by 2010
has been missed. Hochkirch et al. (2013, Conserv. Lett. 6: 462-467) identified
four major shortcomings of the current implementation of the directive
concerning prioritization of the annexes, conservation plans, survey systems
and financial resources. However they did not account for the intended network
character of the Natura 2000 sites, an aspect of highest relevance. This
response letter deals with this shortcoming as it is the prerequisite, over any
other strategies, ensuring a Natura 2020 network being worth its name.

1409.0356,2015-05-13,Ising model description of long range correlations in DNA sequences,"  We model long range correlations of nucleotides in the human DNA sequence
using the long range one dimensional Ising model. We show that for distances
between $10^3$ and $10^6$ bp the correlations show an universal behaviour and
may be described by the non-mean field limit of the long range 1d Ising model.
This allows us to make some testable hypothesis on the nature of the
interaction between distant portions of the DNA chain which led to the DNA
structure that we observe today in higher eukaryotes.

1409.6895,2017-04-20,The entropic basis of collective behaviour,"  In this paper, we identify a radically new viewpoint on the collective
behaviour of groups of intelligent agents. We first develop a highly general
abstract model for the possible future lives that these agents may encounter as
a result of their decisions. In the context of these possible futures, we show
that the causal entropic principle, whereby agents follow behavioural rules
that maximise their entropy over all paths through the future, predicts many of
the observed features of social interactions between individuals in both human
and animal groups. Our results indicate that agents are often able to maximise
their future path entropy by remaining cohesive as a group, and that this
cohesion leads to collectively intelligent outcomes that depend strongly on the
distribution of the number of future paths that are possible. We derive social
interaction rules that are consistent with maximum-entropy group behaviour for
both discrete and continuous decision spaces. Our analysis further predicts
that social interactions are likely to be fundamentally based on Weber's law of
response to proportional stimuli, supporting many studies that find a
neurological basis for this stimulus-response mechanism, and providing a novel
basis for the common assumption of linearly additive 'social forces' in
simulation studies of collective behaviour.

1409.7280,2017-04-12,"Population pressure and global markets drive a decade of forest cover
  change in Africa's Albertine Rift","  The Albertine Rift region faces rapid human population growth, while being a
biodiversity hotspot. Using satellite-derived continuous forest cover change
data, we examined national socioeconomic, demographic, and agricultural
production data, and local demographic and geographic variables to assess
multilevel forces driving significant local forest cover loss and gain outside
protected areas during the first decade of this century. Because the processes
that drive forest cover loss and gain are expected to be different, we
constructed models of change in each direction. Although forest cover change
varied by country, national level population change was the strongest driver of
forest loss rate for all countries, with a population doubling predicted to
cause 2.06 percent annual cover loss, while doubling tea production was
predicted to cause 1.90 percent. The rate of forest cover gain was associated
positively with increased production of the local staple crop cassava, but
negatively with local population density and meat production, suggesting
production drivers at multiple levels mitigate reforestation. We found a small,
but significant, decrease of forest cover loss rate with increasing distance
from protected areas, supporting studies suggesting higher rates of landscape
change near protected areas. While local population density mitigated the rate
of forest cover gain, cover loss also correlated to lower local population
density, an apparent paradox, but consistent with findings that larger scale
forces outweigh local drivers of deforestation. This implicates demographic and
market forces at national and international scales as critical drivers of
change, calling into question the necessary scale of forest protection policy
in this biodiversity hotspot.
"
1410.0566,2014-10-03,Geometry of Morphogenesis,"  We introduce a formalism for the geometry of eukaryotic cells and
organisms.Cells are taken to be star-convex with good biological reason. This
allows for a convenient description of their extent in space as well as all
manner of cell surface gradients. We assume that a spectrum of such cell
surface markers determines an epigenetic code for organism shape. The union of
cells in space at a moment in time is by definition the organism taken as a
metric subspace of Euclidean space, which can be further equipped with an
arbitrary measure. Each cell determines a point in space thus assigning a
finite configuration of distinct points in space to an organism, and a bundle
over this configuration space is introduced with fiber a Hilbert space
recording specific epigenetic data. On this bundle, a Lagrangian formulation of
morphogenetic dynamics is proposed based on Gromov-Hausdorff distance which at
once describes both embryo development and regenerative growth.

1410.1134,2015-04-28,"Selectivity filter gate versus voltage-sensitive gate: A study of
  quantum probabilities in the Hodgkin-Huxley equation","  The Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model is a powerful model to explain different
aspects of spike generation in excitable cells. However, the HH model was
proposed in 1952 when the real structure of the ion channel was unknown. It is
now common knowledge that in many ion-channel proteins the flow of ions through
the pore is governed by a gate, comprising a so-called selectivity filter
inside the ion channel, which can be controlled by electrical interactions. The
selectivity filter is believed to be responsible for the selection and fast
conduction of particular ions across the membrane of an excitable cell. Other
(generally larger) parts of the molecule such as the pore-domain gate control
the access of ions to the channel protein. In fact, two types of gates are
considered here for ion channels: the external gate, which is the voltage
sensitive gate, and the internal gate which is the selectivity filter gate
(SFG). Some quantum effects are to expected in the SFG due to its small
dimensions, which may play an important role in the operation of an ion
channel. Here, we examine parameters in a generalized model of HH to see
whether any parameter affects the spike generation. Our results indicate that
the previously suggested semi-quantum-classical equation proposed by Bernroider
and Summhammer (BS) agrees strongly with the HH equation under different
conditions and may even provide a better explanation in some cases. We conclude
that the BS model can refine the classical HH model substantially.

function remain to be elucidated. In addition the GC-content variations among
species still represent an enigma. Both these two misteries can have a common
explanation: we hypothesize that the role of junk DNA is to preserve the
mutations probability that is intrinsically reduced in GC-poorest genomes.

1411.1498,2014-11-07,"Experimental Investigation of Distant Cellular Interaction among Adipose
  Derived Stem-Cells","  In addition to chemical and mechanical interactions between cells
electromagnetic field produced by cells has been considered as another form of
signaling for cell-cell communication. The aim of this study is evaluation of
electromagnetic effects on viability of Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs)
without co-culturing. In this study, stem cells were isolated from human
adipose tissue enzymatically and proliferated in monolayer culture. Then,
5.(10^4) adipose-derived stem cells were cultured in each well of the test
plate. In the first row (4 wells), ADSCs as inducer cells were cultured in
DMEM1 with 10 ng/ml Fibroblast growth factor (FGF). In adjacent and the last
rows, ADSCs were cultured without FGF (as detector cells). After the three and
five days the viability of cells were evaluated. Moreover, ADSCs were cultured
in the same conditions but the inducer cells were placed once in the UV-filter
tube and once in the quartz tube to see whether there is electromagnetic
interaction among cells. Inducer cells caused significant cell proliferation in
adjacent row cells (p- value<0.01) in the fifth day. However, using the
UV-filter tube and quartz tube both reduced the effect of inducer cells on
adjacent cells significantly. As a conclusion, we could detect distant cellular
interaction (DCI) among adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs), but it was not
electromagnetic signaling. Our results show that ADSCs affect each other via
volatile signaling as a chemical distant cellular interaction (CDCI).

1411.1955,2014-11-10,"Is there any measurable benefit in publishing preprints in the arXiv
  section Quantitative Biology?","  A public preprint server such as arXiv allows authors to publish their
manuscripts before submitting them to journals for peer review. It offers the
chance to establish priority by making the results available upon completion.
This article presents the arXiv section Quantitative Biology and investigates
the advantages of preprint publications in terms of reception, which can be
measured by means of citations. This paper focuses on the publication and
citation delay, citation counts and the authors publishing their e-prints on
arXiv. Moreover, the paper discusses the benefit for scientists as well as
publishers. The results that are based on 12 selected journals show that
submitting preprints to arXiv has become more common in the past few years, but
the number of papers submitted to Quantitative Biology is still small and
represents only a fraction of the total research output in biology. An immense
advantage of arXiv is to overcome the long publication delay resulting from
peer review. Although preprints are visible prior to the officially published
articles, a significant citation advantage was only found for the Journal of
Theoretical Biology.

1411.2205,2014-11-11,A Model on Genome Evolution,"  A model of genome evolution is proposed. Based on three assumptions the
evolutionary theory of a genome is formulated. The general law on the direction
of genome evolution is given. Both the deterministic classical equation and the
stochastic quantum equation are proposed. It is proved that the classical
equation can be put in a form of the least action principle and the latter can
be used for obtaining the quantum generalization of the evolutionary law. The
wave equation and uncertainty relation for the quantum evolution are deduced
logically. It is shown that the classical trajectory is a limiting case of the
general quantum evolution depicted in the coarse-grained time. The observed
smooth/sudden evolution is interpreted by the alternating occurrence of the
classical and quantum phases. The speciation event is explained by the quantum
transition in quantum phase. Fundamental constants of time dimension, the
quantization constant and the evolutionary inertia, are introduced for
characterizing the genome evolution. The size of minimum genome is deduced from
the quantum uncertainty lower bound. The present work shows the quantum law may
be more general than thought, since it plays key roles not only in atomic
physics, but also in genome evolution.

1411.2761,2014-11-14,Entropy and long-range correlations in DNA sequences,"  We analyze the structure of DNA molecules of different organisms by using the
additive Markov chain approach. Transforming nucleotide sequences into binary
strings, we perform statistical analysis of the corresponding ""texts"". We
develop the theory of N-step additive binary stationary ergodic Markov chains
and analyze their differential entropy. Supposing that the correlations are
weak we express the conditional probability function of the chain by means of
the pair correlation function and represent the entropy as a functional of the
pair correlator. Since the model uses two point correlators instead of
probability of block occurring, it makes possible to calculate the entropy of
subsequences at much longer distances than with the use of the standard
methods. We utilize the obtained analytical result for numerical evaluation of
the entropy of coarse-grained DNA texts. We believe that the entropy study can
be used for biological classification of living species.

1411.5948,2014-11-24,"A High Power-Density Mediator-Free Microfluidic Biophotovoltaic Device
  for Cyanobacterial Cells","  Biophotovoltaics has emerged as a promising technology for generating
renewable energy since it relies on living organisms as inexpensive,
self-repairing and readily available catalysts to produce electricity from an
abundant resource - sunlight. The efficiency of biophotovoltaic cells, however,
has remained significantly lower than that achievable through synthetic
materials. Here, we devise a platform to harness the large power densities
afforded by miniaturised geometries. To this effect, we have developed a
soft-lithography approach for the fabrication of microfluidic biophotovoltaic
devices that do not require membranes or mediators. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
cells were injected and allowed to settle on the anode, permitting the physical
proximity between cells and electrode required for mediator-free operation. We
demonstrate power densities of above 100 mW/m2 for a chlorophyll concentration
of 100 {\mu}M under white light, a high value for biophotovoltaic devices
without extrinsic supply of additional energy.

1411.6576,2014-11-25,Biological effects of pulsating magnetic fields: role of solitons,"  In this paper, we analyze biological effects produced by magnetic fields in
order to elucidate the physical mechanisms, which can produce them. We show
that there is a chierarchy of such mechanisms and that the mutual interplay
between them can result in the synergetic outcome. In particular, we analyze
the biological effects of magnetic fields on soliton mediated charge transport
in the redox processes in living organisms. Such solitons are described by
nonlinear systems of equations and represent electrons that are self-trapped in
alpha-helical polypeptides due to the moderately strong electron-lattice
interaction. They represent a particular type of disssipativeless large
polarons in low-dimensional systems. We show that the effective mass of
solitons in the is different from the mass of free electrons, and that there is
a resonant effect of the magnetic fields on the dynamics of solitons, and,
hence, on charge transport that accompanies photosynthesis and respiration.
These effects can result in non-thermal resonant effects of magnetic fields on
redox processes in particular, and on the metabolism of the organism in
general. This can explain physical mechanisms of therapies based on applying
magnetic fields.

1412.7551,2015-04-20,A Simulation for Neurophotonic Quantum Computation in Visual Pathways,"  One of the answers to the measurement problem in quantum theory is given by
the Copenhagen-Interpretation of quantum theory (i.e. orthodox quantum theory)
in which the wave function collapse happens in (by) the mind of observer. In
fact, at first, great scientists like Von Neumann, London, Bauer and Wigner
(initially) believed that the wave function collapse occurs in the brain or is
caused by the consciousness of observer. However, this issue has been stayed
yet very controversial. In fact, there are many challenging discussions about
the survival of quantum effects in microscopic structures of the human brain,
which is mainly because of quick decoherence of quantum states due to hot, wet
and noisy environment of the brain that forbids long life coherence for brain
processing. Nevertheless, there are also several arguments and evidences that
emergence of large coherent states is feasible in the brain. In this paper, our
approach is based on the latter in which macroscopic quantum states are
probable in the human brain. Here, we simulate the delayed luminescence of
photons in neurons with a Brassard-like teleportation circuit, i.e. equivalent
to the transfer of quantum states of photons through the visual pathways from
retina to the visual cortex. Indeed, our simulation considers both classical
and quantum mechanical aspects of processing in neurons. As a result and based
on our simulation, it is possible for our brain to receive the exact quantum
states of photons in the visual cortex to be collapsed by our consciousness,
which supports the Copenhagen-Interpretation of measurement problem in quantum
theory.

1501.00910,2015-01-07,Native American Flute Ergonomics,"  This study surveyed ergonomic issues in 308 Native American flute players. It
also correlated the physical measurements of a subgroup of 33 participants with
the largest flute they found comfortable. The data was used to derive a
predictive formula for the largest comfortable flute based on physical
measurements. The median age of players was 63 years with a mean of 6.9 years
playing Native American flute. Females reported significantly less time playing
the instrument (p = .004), but significantly faster self-reported progress
rates (p = .001). Physical discomfort was experienced by 47-64% of players at
least some of the time. Over 10% of players reported moderate discomfort on an
average basis. Females report significantly higher maximum and average physical
discomfort than males (p < .001 and p = .015, respectively). Height, arm span,
hand span, and reported length of time playing and experience level all
correlated with the largest flute that the player found comfortable.
Multivariate coefficient analysis on those factors yielded a formula with a
strong correlation to the largest comfortable flute (r = +.650). However, the
formula does not have sufficient correlation to have value in predicting flute
design. Customization of Native American flutes with the goal of improving
ergonomics is proposed as a worthwhile goal.

1501.01620,2015-07-01,Transduction of DNA information through water and electromagnetic waves,"  The experimental conditions by which electromagnetic signals (EMS) of low
frequency can be emitted by diluted aqueous solutions of some bacterial and
viral DNAs are described. That the recorded EMS and nanostructures induced in
water carry the DNA information (sequence) is shown by retrieval of that same
DNA by classical PCR amplification using the TAQ polymerase, including both
primers and nucleotides. Moreover, such a transduction process has also been
observed in living human cells exposed to EMS irradiation. These experiments
suggest that coherent long range molecular interaction must be at work in water
so to allow the observed features. The quantum field theory analysis of the
phenomenon is presented.

1501.05842,2015-01-26,"Heart rate and its variability as an indicator of mental health in male
  prisoners","  Heart rate (HR) and its variability (HRV) has been proposed as a marker for
depressive symptoms and other aspects of mental health. However, the real
correlation between them is presently uncertain, as previous studies have
generally been conducted on the basis of small samples. In a sample of 113
adult male prisoners, we analyzed correlations between five measures of HR/HRV
and five psychological measures of mental health aspects (depression, state and
trait anxiety, and social relationships). We used Nadaraya-Watson
non-parametric regression in both directions and age-stratified Spearman
correlation to detect possible relations. Despite strong correlations among
HR/HRV measures and among psychological measures, correlations between HR/HRV
and psychological measures were low and non-significant for the overall sample.
However, we found an age dependency, suggesting some correlations in younger
people (HR with STAI-State, r = 0.39; with HADS-Anxiety, r = 0.52; both p <
.005). Overall, the general utility of HR/HRV as a marker for mental health
across populations remains unclear. Future research should address age and
other potential confounders more consistently.

dark noise observed for vertebrate rod and cone pigments. Luo et al (Science,

1501.07158,2015-01-29,"Review of Magnetic Shark Deterrents: Hypothetical Mechanisms and
  Evidence for Selectivity","  Several papers published since 2006 describe effects of magnetic fields on
elasmobranchs and assess their utility in reducing negative interactions
between sharks and humans, including bycatch reduction. Most of these repeat a
single untested hypothesis regarding physical mechanisms by which elasmobranchs
detect magnetic fields and also neglect careful consideration of
magnetoreception in teleosts. Several species of teleosts are known to have
magnetoreception based in biogenic magnetite, and direct magnetic field
detection also has support in several species of elasmobranchs. The overly
narrow focus of earlier papers on the unsupported hypothesis that
magnetoreception in elasmobranchs is based in the ampullae of Lorenzini creates
the impression that all teleosts will be insensitive to magnetic deterrents.
However, magnetite based magnetoreception has been demonstrated in several
teleosts, and is supported in others. Furthermore, electroreception is present
in many teleost species; therefore, the possibility of induction based indirect
magnetoreception should be considered. Finally, experiments reported as
demonstrating insensitivity in teleost species to magnetic deterrents suffer
from inadequate design and sample sizes to reject the hypothesis of magnetic
detection in any given species. Since adoption of deterrent hook technologies
depends on both deterrent effects in sharks and the absence of effects in
target teleosts, the hypothesis of detection in teleost species must be
independently tested with adequate sample sizes.

1502.02419,2017-04-03,"Measurement in biological systems from the self-organisation point of
  view","  Measurement in biological systems became a subject of concern as a
consequence of numerous reports on limited reproducibility of experimental
results. To reveal origins of this inconsistency, we have examined general
features of biological systems as dynamical systems far from not only their
chemical equilibrium, but, in most cases, also of their Lyapunov stable states.
Thus, in biological experiments, we do not observe states, but distinct
trajectories followed by the examined organism. If one of the possible
sequences is selected, a minute sub-section of the whole problem is obtained,
sometimes in a seemingly highly reproducible manner. But the state of the
organism is known only if a complete set of possible trajectories is known. And
this is often practically impossible. Therefore, we propose a different
framework for reporting and analysis of biological experiments, respecting the
view of non-linear mathematics. This view should be used to avoid
overoptimistic results, which have to be consequently retracted or largely
complemented. An increase of specification of experimental procedures is the
way for better understanding of the scope of paths, which the biological system
may be evolving. And it is hidden in the evolution of experimental protocols.

1502.02689,2015-02-23,Heterogeneity of cells may explain allometric scaling of metabolic rate,"  The origin of allometric scaling of metabolic rate is a long-standing
question in biology. Several models have been proposed for explaining the
origin; however, they have advantages and disadvantages. In particular,
previous models only demonstrate either two important observations for the
allometric scaling: the variability of scaling exponents and predominance of
3/4-power law. Thus, these models have a dispute over their validity. In this
study, we propose a simple geometry model, and show that a hypothesis that
total surface area of cells determines metabolic rate can reproduce these two
observations by combining two concepts: the impact of cell sizes on metabolic
rate and fractal-like (hierarchical) organization. The proposed model both
theoretically and numerically demonstrates the approximately 3/4-power law
although several different biological strategies are considered. The model
validity is confirmed using empirical data. Furthermore, the model suggests the
importance of heterogeneity of cell size for the emergence of the allometric
scaling. The proposed model provides intuitive and unique insights into the
origin of allometric scaling laws in biology, despite several limitations of
the model.

1502.03815,2015-02-18,Spices form the basis of food pairing in Indian cuisine,"  Culinary practices are influenced by climate, culture, history and geography.
Molecular composition of recipes in a cuisine reveals patterns in food
preferences. Indian cuisine encompasses a number of diverse sub-cuisines
separated by geographies, climates and cultures. Its culinary system has a long
history of health-centric dietary practices focused on disease prevention and
promotion of health. We study food pairing in recipes of Indian cuisine to show
that, in contrast to positive food pairing reported in some Western cuisines,
Indian cuisine has a strong signature of negative food pairing; more the extent
of flavor sharing between any two ingredients, lesser their co-occurrence. This
feature is independent of recipe size and is not explained by ingredient
category-based recipe constitution alone. Ingredient frequency emerged as the
dominant factor specifying the characteristic flavor sharing pattern of the
cuisine. Spices, individually and as a category, form the basis of ingredient
composition in Indian cuisine. We also present a culinary evolution model which
reproduces ingredient use distribution as well as negative food pairing of the
cuisine. Our study provides a basis for designing novel signature recipes,
healthy recipe alterations and recipe recommender systems.

capable of providing invaluable information on the physiological status of an
individual and, thereby, could serve as signs-of-life for detecting victims
after natural or man-made disasters. In this review a database of potential
biomarkers of human presence was created on the basis of existing literature
reports on volatiles in human breath, skin emanation, blood, and urine.
Approximate fluxes of these species from the human body were estimated and used
to predict their concentrations in the vicinity of victims. The proposed
markers were classified into groups of different potential for victim
detection. The major classification discriminants were the capability of
detection by portable, real-time analytical instruments and background levels
in urban environment. The data summarized in this review are intended to assist
studies on the detection of humans via chemical analysis and accelerate
investigations in this area of knowledge.
"
1502.07251,2015-08-12,Mass Action and Conservation of Current,"  The law of mass action is used widely. The law of mass action does not
automatically conserve current, as is clear from mathematics of a simple case,
chosen to illustrate the issues. The law of mass action does not force a series
of chemical reactions to have the same current flow everywhere. Interruption of
far-away current does not stop current everywhere in a series of chemical
reactions, and so does not obey Maxwell equations. An additional constraint and
equation is needed to enforce the global continuity of current flow. The
additional constraint is introduced in this paper in the special case that the
chemical reaction describes spatial movement through narrow channels. In that
case, a fully consistent treatment is possible using a variety of models of
charge movement. The general case must be dealt with by variational methods
that enforce consistency of all the physical laws involved. Variational methods
have only recently been developed to ensure that charge flow is conserved
globally, along with mass, in dissipative systems like ions in solution or
proteins. The Energy Variational Approach EnVarA should allow the development
of more robust models of chemical, biochemical, and biological systems, making
practical devices more easy to design and build. These difficulties arise away
from equilibrium, when current flows, and the law of mass action is applied to
a non-equilibrium situation, different from the systems considered when the law
was originally derived. Non-equilibrium systems are important. Almost all of
biology occurs away from equilibrium. Almost all devices of our technology
function away from equilibrium. I believe robust models and device designs in
the chemical world will not be possible until continuity of current is embedded
in a generalization of the law of mass action using a consistent variational
model of energy and dissipation.

1503.01096,2015-06-24,Similarity Is Not Enough: Tipping Points of Ebola Zaire Mortalities,"  In early 2014 an outbreak of a slightly mutated Zaire Ebola subtype appeared
in West Africa which is less virulent than 1976 and 1994 strains. The numbers
of cases per year appear to be ~ 1000 times larger than the earlier strains,
suggesting a greatly enhanced transmissibility. Although the fraction of the
2014 spike glycoprotein mutations is very small (~3%), the mortality is
significantly reduced, while the transmission appears to have increased
strongly. Bioinformatic scaling had previously shown similar inversely
correlated trends in virulence and transmission in N1 (H1N1) and N2 (H3N2)
influenza spike glycoprotein mutations. These trends appear to be related to
various external factors (migration, availability of pure water, and
vaccination programs). The molecular mechanisms for Ebola's mutational response
involve mainly changes in the disordered mucin-like domain (MLD) of its spike
glycoprotein amino acids. The MLD has been observed to form the tip of an
oligomeric amphiphilic wedge that selectively pries apart cell-cell interfaces
via an oxidative mechanism.

features embedded in a DNA. The codongrams and a2grams are offered as an
alternative to spectrograms and scalograms. Twenty different a^2grams are
defined for a genome, one for each amino acid (valgram is an a^2gram for
valine; alagram is an a^2gram for alanine and so on). They provide information
about the distribution and occurrence of the investigated amino acid. In
particular, the metgram can be used to find out potential start position of
genes within a genome. This approach can help implementing a new diagnosis test
for genetic diseases by providing a type of DNA-medical imaging.

1503.02570,2015-03-10,"The Genetic Code revisited: Inner-to-outer map, 2D-Gray map, and
  World-map Genetic Representations","  How to represent the genetic code? Despite the fact that it is extensively
known, the DNA mapping into proteins remains as one of the relevant discoveries
of genetics. However, modern genomic signal processing usually requires
converting symbolic-DNA strings into complex-valued signals in order to take
full advantage of a broad variety of digital processing techniques. The genetic
code is revisited in this paper, addressing alternative representations for it,
which can be worthy for genomic signal processing. Three original
representations are discussed. The inner-to-outer map builds on the unbalanced
role of nucleotides of a 'codon' and it seems to be suitable for handling
information-theory-based matter. The two-dimensional-Gray map representation is
offered as a mathematically structured map that can help interpreting
spectrograms or scalograms. Finally, the world-map representation for the
genetic code is investigated, which can particularly be valuable for
educational purposes -besides furnishing plenty of room for application of
distance-based algorithms.

1503.02576,2015-05-18,"A link between solar events and congenital malformations: Is ionizing
  radiation enough to explain it?","  Cosmic rays are known to cause biological effects directly and through
ionizing radiation produced by their secondaries. These effects have been
detected in airline crews and other specific cases where members of the
population are exposed to above average secondary fluxes. Recent work has found
a correlation between solar particle events and congenital malformations. In
this work we use the results of computational simulations to approximate the
ionizing radiation from such events as well as longer term increases in cosmic
ray flux. We find that the amounts of ionizing radiation produced by these
events are insufficient to produce congenital malformations under the current
paradigm regarding muon ionizing radiation. We believe that further work is
needed to determine the correct ionizing radiation contribution of cosmogenic
muons. We suggest that more extensive measurements of muon radiation effects
may show a larger contribution to ionizing radiation dose than currently
assumed.

1503.07040,2017-01-04,Traditional aging theories: which ones are useful?,"  Many theories have been proposed to answer two questions on aging: ""Why do we
age?"" and ""How do we age?"" Among them, evolutionary theories are proposed to
interpret the evolutionary advantage of aging, and ""saving resources for group
benefit"" is thought to be the purpose of aging. However for saving resources, a
more economic strategy should be to make a rapid death to the individuals who
are over the reproduction age rather than to make them aging. Biological
theories are proposed to identify the causes and the biological processes of
aging. However, some theories including cell senescence/telomere theory,
gene-controlling theory, and developmental theory, have unfortunately ignored
the influence of damage on aging. Free-radical theory suggests that free
radicals by causing intrinsic damage are the main cause of aging. However, even
if intracellular free radicals cause injuries, they could be only associated
with some but not all of the aging changes. Damage (fault)-accumulation theory
predicts that faults as intrinsic damage can accumulate and lead to aging.
However, in fact an unrepaired fault could not possibly remain in a living
organism, since it can destroy the integrity of tissue structure and cause
rapid failure of the organism. These traditional theories are all incomplete on
interpreting aging phenomena. Nevertheless, developmental theory and damage
(fault)-accumulation theory are more useful, because they have recognized the
importance of damage and development process in aging. Some physical theories
are useful, because they point out the common characteristics of aging changes,
including loss of complexity, consequence of increase of entropy, and failure
of information-transmission. An advanced theory, which can include all of these
useful ideas in traditional theories, is needed.
"
1503.08076,2018-02-07,Development of aging changes: self-accelerating and inhomogeneous,"  Aging changes including age spots and atherosclerotic plaques develop in an
inhomogeneous and accelerated manner. For understanding this phenomenon, some
aging changes are analyzed by Misrepair mechanism, a mechanism proposed in
Misrepair-accumulation theory. I. Misrepair is a strategy of repair for
survival of an organism in situations of severe injuries; however a Misrepair
alters the structure of a tissue, a cell or a molecule, which are the
sub-structures of an organism. II. Misrepair of a sub-structure also alters the
spatial relationship of this sub-structure with its neighbor sub-structures.
Thus a Misrepair leads to increased damage-sensitivity and reduced
repair-efficiency of these sub-structures. As a result, Misrepairs have a
tendency to occur to the sub-structure and its neighbor sub-structures where an
old Misrepair has taken place. In return, new Misrepairs will increase again
the damage-sensitivity of these sub-structures and the surrounding
sub-structures. By such a vicious circle, the frequency of Misrepairs to these
sub-structures is increased and the range of affected sub-structures is
enlarged after each time of Misrepair. Thus, accumulation of Misrepairs is
focalized and self-accelerating. III. Focalized accumulation of Misrepairs
leads to formation and growing of a ""spot"" or ""plaque"" in a tissue. Growing of
a spot is self-accelerating, and old spots grow faster than new ones. New spots
tend to develop close to old ones, resulting in an inhomogeneous distribution
of spots. In conclusion, the inhomogeneous development of aging changes is a
result of self-accelerated and focalized accumulation of Misrepairs; and the
process of aging is self-accelerating.

1505.02033,2016-04-19,Taylor's power law: before and after 50 years of scientific scrutiny,"  Taylor's power law is one of the mostly widely known empirical patterns in
ecology discovered in the 20th century. It states that the variance of species
population density scales as a power-law function of the mean population
density. Taylor's power law was named after the British ecologist Lionel Roy
Taylor. During the past half-century, Taylor's power law was confirmed for
thousands of biological species and even for non-biological quantities.
Numerous theories and models have been proposed to explain the mechanisms of
Taylor's power law. However an understanding of the historical origin of this
ubiquitous scaling pattern is lacking. This work reviews two research aspects
that are fundamental to the discovery of Taylor's power law and provides an
outlook of its future studies.

1505.04656,2015-12-31,Quaternionic representation of the genetic code,"  A heuristic diagram of the evolution of the standard genetic code is
presented. It incorporates, in a way that resembles the energy levels of an
atom, the physical notion of broken symmetry and it is consistent with original
ideas by Crick on the origin and evolution of the code as well as with the
chronological order of appearence of the amino acids along the evolution as
inferred from work that mixtures known experimental results with theoretical
speculations. Suggested by the diagram we propose a Hamilton quaternions based
mathematical representation of the code as it stands now-a-days. The central
object in the description is a codon function that assigns to each amino acid
an integer quaternion in such a way that the observed code degeneration is
preserved. We emphasize the advantages of a quaternionic representation of
amino acids taking as an example the folding of proteins. With this aim we
propose an algorithm to go from the quaternions sequence to the protein three
dimensional structure which can be compared with the corresponding experimental
one stored at the Protein Data Bank. In our criterion the mathematical
representation of the genetic code in terms of quaternions merits to be taken
into account because it describes not only most of the known properties of the
genetic code but also opens new perspectives that are mainly derived from the
close relationship between quaternions and rotations.

(Freeman K-sets) present functional distribution reproducing Bessel function
behavior. We model such processes with couples of damped/amplified oscillators
which provide time dependent representation of Bessel equation. The root loci
of poles and zeros conform to solutions of K-sets. Some light is shed on the
problem of filling the gap between the cellular level dynamics and the brain
functional activity. Breakdown of time-reversal symmetry is related with the
cortex thermodynamic features. This provides a possible mechanism to deduce
lifetime of recorded memory.

1507.03197,2015-07-14,"TOPO: Improving remote homologue recognition via identifying common
  protein structure framework","  Protein structure prediction remains a challenge in the field of
computational biology. Traditional protein structure prediction approaches
include template-based modelling (say, homology modelling, and threading), and
ab initio. A threading algorithm takes a query protein sequence as input,
recognizes the most likely fold, and finally reports the alignments of the
query sequence to structure-known templates as output. The existing threading
approaches mainly utilizes the information of protein sequence profile, solvent
accessibility, contact probability, etc., and correctly recognize folds for
some proteins. However, the existing threading approaches show poorly
performance for remote homology proteins. How to improve the fold recognition
for remote homology proteins remains to be a difficult task for protein

of the main alkaloids found in the seeds of Argemone Mexicana Linn, a prickly
poppy, which is considered one of the most important species of plants in
traditional Mexican and Indian medicine system. The seeds have toxic properties
as well as bactericide, hallucinogenic, fungicide, insecticide, in
isoquinolines and sanguinarine alkaloids such as berberine. A computational
study of the molecular geometry of the molecules through molecular mechanics of

berberine, chelerythrine, copsitine, dihydrosanguinarine, protopine and
sanguinarine. The studied alkaloids form two groups having similar charge
distribution among themselves, which have dipole moments of these two times
higher than in the other group.

1508.06816,2015-08-28,A stochastic model of ant trail following with two pheromones,"  Colonies of ants are systems of interacting living organisms in which
interactions between individuals and their environment can produce a reliable
performance of a complex tasks without the need for centralised control.
Particularly remarkable is the process of formation of refined paths between
the nest and food sources that is essential for successful foraging. We have
designed a simple stochastic off-lattice model of ant foraging in the absence
of direct communication. The motion of ants is governed by two components - a
random change in direction of motion that improves ability to explore the
environment (facilitating food discovery), and a non-random global indirect
interaction component based on pheromone signalling. Using numerical
simulations we have studied the model behaviour in different parameter regimes
and tested the ability of our model ants to adapt to changes in the external
environment. The simulated behaviour of ants in the model recapitulated the
experimentally observed behaviours of real ants. Furthermore we observe
interesting synchronization in ant movement patterns which vary with the
diffusion properties of the pheromones.

1508.07244,2016-04-20,"Vaccine escape in 2013-4 and the hydropathic evolution of glycoproteins
  of A/H3N2 viruses","  More virulent strains of influenza virus subtypes H1N1 appeared widely in
2007 and H3N2 in 2011, and especially 2013-4, when the effectiveness of the
H3N2 vaccine decreased nearly to zero. The amino acid differences of
neuraminidase from prior less virulent strains appear to be small (<1%) when
tabulated through sequence alignments and counting site identities and
similarities. Here we show how analyzing fractal hydropathic forces responsible
for neuraminidase globular compaction and modularity quantifies the mutational
origins of increased virulence. It also predicts vaccine escape and specifies
optimized targets for the 2015 H3N2 vaccine different from the WHO target.
Unlike some earlier methods based on measuring hemagglutinin antigenic drift
and ferret sera, which take several years, cover only a few candidate strains,
and are ambiguous, the new methods are timely and can be completed, using NCBI
and GISAID amino acid sequences only, in a few days.

studies on simple microorganisms: brewing yeasts are presented. Lifetime of
ortho - positronium (o-Ps) were found to change from 2.4 to 2.9 ns (longer
lived component) for lyophilised and aqueous yeasts, respectively. Also
hygroscopicity of yeasts in time was examined, allowing to check how water -
the main component of the cell - affects PALS parameters, thus lifetime of o-Ps
were found to change from 1.2 to 1.4 ns (shorter lived component) for the dried
yeasts. The time sufficient to hydrate the cells was found below 10 hours. In
the presence of liquid water an indication of reorganization of yeast in the
molecular scale was observed.
  Microscopic images of the lyophilised, dried and wet yeasts with best
possible resolution were obtained using Inverted Microscopy (IM) and
Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) methods. As a result visible

1509.03775,2016-04-27,Accelerating Scientific Publication in Biology,"  Scientific publications enable results and ideas to be transmitted throughout
the scientific community. The number and type of journal publications also have
become the primary criteria used in evaluating career advancement. Our analysis
suggests that publication practices have changed considerably in the life
sciences over the past thirty years. More experimental data is now required for
publication, and the average time required for graduate students to publish
their first paper has increased and is approaching the desirable duration of
Ph.D. training. Since publication is generally a requirement for career
progression, schemes to reduce the time of graduate student and postdoctoral
training may be difficult to implement without also considering new mechanisms
for accelerating communication of their work. The increasing time to
publication also delays potential catalytic effects that ensue when many
scientists have access to new information. The time has come for life
scientists, funding agencies, and publishers to discuss how to communicate new
findings in a way that best serves the interests of the public and the
scientific community.

1509.08912,2015-10-01,A common origin for 3/4- and 2/3-power rules in metabolic scaling,"  A central debate in biology has been the allometric scaling of metabolic
rate. Kleiber's observation that animals' basal metabolic rate scales to the
3/4-power of body mass (Kleiber's rule) has been the prevailing hypothesis in
the last eight decades. Increasingly, more evidences are supporting the
alternative 2/3-power scaling rule, especially for smaller animals. The
2/3-rule dates back to before Kleiber's time and was thought to originate from
the surface to volume relationship in Euclidean geometry. In this study, we
show that both the 3/4- and 2/3-scaling rules have in fact one common origin.
They are governed by animals' nutrient supply networks-their vascular systems
that obey Murray's law. Murray's law describes the branching pattern of energy
optimized vascular network under laminar flow. It is generally regarded as
being closely followed by blood vessels. Our analysis agrees with experimental
observations and recent numerical analyses that showed a curvature in metabolic
scaling. When applied to metabolic data, our model accurately produces the
observed 2/3-scaling rule for small animals of ~10 kg or less and the 3/4-rule
for all animals excluding the smallest ones (~15 g). The model has broad
implications to the ongoing debate. It proves that both the 3/4- and
2/3-exponents are phenomenological approximations of the same scaling rule
within their applicable mass ranges, and that the 2/3-rule does not originate
from the classical surface law.

1510.01278,2015-10-06,"A Mathematical Model for the Genetic Code(s) Based on Fibonacci Numbers
  and their q-Analogues","  This work aims at showing the relevance and the applications possibilities of
the Fibonacci sequence, and also its q-deformed or quantum extension, in the
study of the genetic code(s). First, after the presentation of a new formula,
an indexed double Fibonacci sequence, comprising the first six Fibonacci
numbers, is shown to describe the 20 amino acids multiplets and their
degeneracy as well as a characteristic pattern for the 61 meaningful codons.
Next, the twenty amino acids, classified according to their increasing
atom-number (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur), exhibit several Fibonacci
sequence patterns. Several mathematical relations are given, describing various
atom-number patterns. Finally, a q-Fibonacci simple phenomenological model,
with q a real deformation parameter, is used to describe, in a unified way, not
only the standard genetic code, when q=1, but also all known slight variations
of this latter, when q~1, as well as the case of the 21st amino acid
(Selenocysteine) and the 22nd one (Pyrrolysine), also when q~1. As a by-product
of this elementary model, we also show that, in the limit q=0, the number of
amino acids reaches the value 6, in good agreement with old and still
persistent claims stating that life, in its early development, could have used
only a small number of amino acids.

1510.01589,2015-10-07,"The species problem and its logic: Inescapable Ambiguity and
  Framework-relativity","  For more than fifty years, taxonomists have proposed numerous alternative
definitions of species while they searched for a unique, comprehensive, and
persuasive definition. This monograph shows that these efforts have been
unnecessary, and indeed have provably been a pursuit of a will o' the wisp
because they have failed to recognize the theoretical impossibility of what
they seek to accomplish. A clear and rigorous understanding of the logic
underlying species definition leads both to a recognition of the inescapable
ambiguity that affects the definition of species, and to a framework-relative
approach to species definition that is logically compelling, i.e., cannot not
be accepted without inconsistency. An appendix reflects upon the conclusions
reached, applying them in an intellectually whimsical taxonomic thought
experiment that conjectures the possibility of an emerging new human species.

1510.02375,2015-10-09,Markovian language model of the DNA and its information content,"  This work proposes a markovian memoryless model for the DNA that simplifies
enormously the complexity of it. We encode nucleotide sequences into symbolic
sequences, called words, from which we establish meaningful length of words and
group of words that share symbolic similarities. Interpreting a node to
represent a group of similar words and edges to represent their functional
connectivity allows us to construct a network of the grammatical rules
governing the appearance of group of words in the DNA. Our model allows to
predict the transition between group of words in the DNA with unprecedented
accuracy, and to easily calculate many informational quantities to better
characterize the DNA. In addition, we reduce the DNA of known bacteria to a
network of only tens of nodes, show how our model can be used to detect similar
(or dissimilar) genes in different organisms, and which sequences of symbols
are responsible for the most of the information content of the DNA. Therefore,
the DNA can indeed be treated as a language, a markovian language, where a
""word"" is an element of a group, and its grammar represents the rules behind
the probability of transitions between any two groups.

upper-limb prostheses. However a training session is necessary in order to set
up the controller that will make s-EMG based movement possible. All data
recorded during the training session are used by a machine learning algorithm
to make a posture classification, that will allow the controller to distinguish
each posture. The aim of this study is to investigate if it's possible to make
a posture classification which can remain valid over time. The next step will
be the study of how it varies depending on the amount of information submitted
to it during the training session in view of real life everyday use of the
upper-limb prosthesis.

  Protein Family: A Mathematical Approach","  The genetic code is the set of rules by which information encoded in genetic
material (DNA or RNA sequences) is translated into proteins (amino acid
sequences) by living cells. The code defines a mapping between tri-nucleotide
sequences, called codons, and amino acids. Since there are 20 amino acids and
64 possible tri-nucleotide sequences, more than one among these 64 triplets can
code for a single amino acid which incorporates the problem of degeneracy. This
manuscript explains the underlying logic of degeneracy of genetic code based on
a mathematical point of view using a parameter named Impression. Classification
of protein family is also a long standing problem in the field of Bio-chemistry
and Genomics. Proteins belonging to a particular class have some similar
bio-chemical properties which are of utmost importance for new drug design.
Using the same parameter Impression and using graph theoretic properties we
have also devised a new way of classifying a protein family.

1512.03660,2016-03-07,Stephane Leduc and the vital exception in the Life Sciences,"  Embryogenesis, the process by which an organism forms and develops, has long
been and still is a major field of investigation in the natural sciences. By
which means, which forces, are embryonic cells and tissues assembled, deformed,
and eventually organized into an animal? Because embryogenesis deeply questions
our understanding of the mechanisms of life, it has motivated many scientific
theories and philosophies over the course of history. While genetics now seems
to have emerged as a natural background to study embryogenesis, it was intuited
long ago that it should also rely on mechanical forces and on the physical
properties of cells and tissues. In the early 20th century, Stephane Leduc
proposed that biology was merely a subset of fluid physics, and argued that
biology should focus on how forces act on living matter. Rejecting vitalism and
life-specific approaches, he designed naive experiments based on osmosis and
diffusion to mimic shapes and phenomena found in living systems, in order to
identify physical mechanisms that could support the development of the embryo.
While Leduc's ideas then had some impact in the field, notably on later
acclaimed D'Arcy Thompson, they fell into oblivion during the later 20th
century. In this article I give an overview of Stephane Leduc's physical
approach to life, and show that the paradigm that he introduced, although long
forsaken, becomes more and more topical today, as developmental biology
increasingly turns to physics and self-organization theories to study the
mechanisms of embryogenesis. His story, I suggest, bears witness to our
reluctance to abandon life-specific approaches in biology.

  Precision/Personalized Evidence-Based Medicine","  Precision medicine emerges as the most important contemporary paradigm shift
of medical practice but has several challenges in evidence formation and
implementation for clinical practice. Precision/Personalized evidence-based
medicine (pEBM) requires theoretical support for decision making and
information management. This study aims to provide the required methodological
framework. Generalized Resemblance Theory of Evidence mainly rests upon
Generalized Theory of Uncertainty which manages information as generalized
constraints rather than limited statistical data, and also Prototype
Resemblance Theory of Disease which defines diseases/conditions when there is a
similarity relationship with prototypes (best examples of the disease). The
proposed theory explains that precisely-personalized structure of evidence is
formed as a generalized constraint on particular research questions, where the
constraining relation deals with averaged effect sizes of studies and its
comparison to null hypothesis; which might be of either probabilistic or
possibilistic nature. Similarity measures were employed to deal with
comparisons of high-dimensional characteristics. Real examples of a
meta-analysis and its clinical application are provided. This is one of the
first attempts for introducing a framework in medicine, which provides optimal
balance between generalizability of formed evidence and homogeneity of studied
populations.

1512.04404,2015-12-15,Simple cellular automata to mimic foraging ants submitted to abduction,"  Many species of ants forage by building up two files: an outbound one moving
from the nest to the foraging area, and a nestbound one, returning from it to
the nest. Those files are eventually submitted to different threats. If the
danger is concentrated at one point of the file, one might expect that ants
returning to the nest will pass danger information to their nestmates moving in
the opposite direction towards the danger area. In this paper, we construct
simple cellular automata models for foraging ants submitted to localized
abduction, were danger information is transmitted using different protocols,
including the possibility of no transmission. The parameters we have used in
the simulations have been estimated from actual experiments under natural
conditions. So, it would be easy to test our information-transmission hypothese
in real experiments. Preliminary experimental results published elsewhere
suggest that the behavior of foraging ants of the species Atta insularis is
best described using the hypothesis of no transmission of danger information.

December 2009, we demonstrate directly the scale of the impact of HIV on
mortality in health services in the pubic sector in South Africa. During the
period under investigation 14,431 people died in the hospital's medical wards,
an average of 11 deaths each day. Of those that died 64 per cent of men and 82
per cent of women were HIV positive. Between the ages of 30 and 40, 94 percent
of men and 96 percent of women of those that died were HIV-positive. These data
not only reflect the extraordinary mortality directly attributable to the
epidemic of HIV but also the massive burden placed on the health services at a
time when triple combination therapy was available and these HIV-related deaths
could have been averted.

alignment, BLOSUM62, with the standard 1982 amino acid hydropathicity scale KD
as well as the modern 2007 hydropathicity scale MZ, and compare the results.
The 20-parameter KD and MZ hydropathicity scales have different thermodynamic
character, corresponding to first and second order transitions. The KD and MZ
comparisons show that the mutation rates reflect quantitative iteration of
qualitative amino acid phobic and philic binary 2x10 properties that define
quaternary 4x5 subgroups (but not quinary 5x4 subgroups), with the modern MZ
bioinformatic scale giving much better results. The quaternary 5 mer MZ 4x5

  Association Learning via a Ratatouille Effect","  Eating behaviors among a large population of children are studied as a
dynamic process driven by nonlinear interactions in the sociocultural school
environment. The impact of food association learning on diet dynamics, inspired
by a pilot study conducted among Arizona children in Pre-Kindergarten to 8th
grades, is used to build simple population-level learning models.
Qualitatively, mathematical studies are used to highlight the possible
ramifications of instruction, learning in nutrition, and health at the
community level. Model results suggest that nutrition education programs at the
population-level have minimal impact on improving eating behaviors, findings
that agree with prior field studies. Hence, the incorporation of food
association learning may be a better strategy for creating resilient
communities of healthy and non-healthy eaters. A \textit{Ratatouille} effect
can be observed when food association learners become food preference learners,
a potential sustainable behavioral change, which in turn, may impact the
overall distribution of healthy eaters. In short, this work evaluates the
effectiveness of population-level intervention strategies and the importance of
institutionalizing nutrition programs that factor in economical, social,
cultural, and environmental elements that mesh well with the norms and values
in the community.

interest, there has been, to our knowledge, no systematic examination of the
full range of relationships and no unification of this diverse range of
functions into a single formalism as we do here. In this paper we define
operators on functions on these lattices based on the M\""obius inversion idea
that map the functions into one another (M\""obius operators.) We show that
these operators form a simple group isomorphic to the symmetric group S3.
Relations among the set of functions on the lattice are transparently expressed
in terms of the operator algebra, and, applied to the information measures, can
be used to derive a wide range of relationships among measures. We describe a
direct relation between sums of conditional log-likelihoods and previously
defined dependency measures. The algebra is naturally generalized which yields
more extensive relationships. This formalism provides a fundamental unification
of information related measures, but isomorphism of all distributive lattices
with the subset lattice implies broad potential application of these results.

1602.01436,2018-06-11,"Roadless space is greatly diminished by logging in intact forest
  landscapes of the Congo Basin","  Forest degradation in the tropics is often associated with roads built for
selective logging. The protection of Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL) that are
not accessible by roads is high on the biodiversity conservation agenda, a
challenge for logging concessions certified by the Forest Stewardship Council
(FSC). A frequently advocated conservation objective is to maximise the
retention of ""roadless space"", a concept that is based on distance to the
nearest road from any point. We developed a novel use of the empty space
function - a general statistical tool based on stochastic geometry and random
sets theory - to calculate roadless space in a part of the Congo Basin where
there has recently been rapid expansion of road networks. We compared the
temporal development of roadless space in certified and non-certified logging
concessions inside and outside areas declared as IFL in the year 2000. Between
1999 and 2007, rapid road network expansion led to a marked loss of roadless
space in IFL. After 2007, this trajectory levelled out in most areas, due to an
equilibrium between newly built roads and abandoned roads that became
revegetated. However, concessions within IFL that have been certified by FSC
since around 2007 showed continued decreases in roadless space, thus reaching a
level comparable to all other concessions. Only national parks remained
road-free. We recommend that forest management policies make the preservation
of large connected forest areas a top priority by effectively monitoring - and
limiting - the occupation of space by roads that are permanently accessible.

1602.05847,2016-02-19,Chirality in a quaternionic representation of the genetic code,"  A quaternionic representation of the genetic code, previously reported by the
authors, is updated in order to incorporate chirality of nucleotide bases and
amino acids. The original representation assigns to each nucleotide base a
prime integer quaternion of norm 7 and involves a function that associates with
each codon, represented by three of these quaternions, another integer
quaternion (amino acid type quaternion) in such a way that the essentials of
the standard genetic code (particulaty its degeneration) are preserved. To show
the advantages of such a quaternionic representation we have, in turn,
associated with each amino acid of a given protein, besides of the type
quaternion, another real one according to its order along the protein (order
quaternion) and have designed an algorithm to go from the primary to the
tertiary structure of the protein by using type and order quaternions. In this
context, we incorporate chirality in our representation by observing that the
set of eight integer quaternions of norm 7 can be partitioned into a pair of
subsets of cardinality four each with their elements mutually conjugates and by
putting they in correspondence one to one with the two sets of enantiomers (D
and L) of the four nucleotide bases adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil,
respectively. Thus, guided by two diagrams proposed for the codes evolution, we
define functions that in each case assign a L- (D-) amino acid type integer
quaternion to the triplets of D- (L-) bases. The assignation is such that for a
given D-amino acid, the associated integer quaternion is the conjugate of that
one corresponding to the enantiomer L. The chiral type quaternions obtained for
the amino acids are used, together with a common set of order quaternions, to
describe the folding of the two classes, L and D, of homochiral proteins.

data that are global in coverage. The tool automates downloading and processing
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets, and training
gradient-boosted machine models on hundreds of millions of observations to
predict future values of the Enhanced Vegetation Index. We compared the
predictive power of different sets of variables (raw spectral MODIS data and

considerably greater predictive power on held-out datasets than simpler

1602.08913,2016-03-01,"X-ray experiment provides a way to reveal the distinction between
  discrete and continuous conformation of myosin head","  The corner stone of the classical model after Huxley and Simmons is
supposition that a myosin head can reside only in several discrete states and
irregularly jumps from one state to another. Until now, it has not been found a
way to experimentally verify this supposition although confirmation or
refutation of the existence of discrete states is crucial for the solution of
myosin motor problem. Here I show that a set of equal myosin heads arranged
equidistantly along an actin filament produce X-ray pattern which varies with
the type of conformation. If the lever arms of all myosin heads reside in one
and the same position (continuous conformation), all the heads have the same
form-factor and equally scatter electromagnetic wave. In this case, only the
geometric factor associated with a spatial ordering of the heads will determine
the X-ray pattern. The situation changes if the average lever arm position is
the same, but inherently every head can reside only in several diverse discrete
states, hopping irregularly from one to another. In this case, the form-factors
corresponding to distinct states are dissimilar, and the increments in phases
of X-rays scattered by different heads are different as well. Inasmuch as every
quantum of radiation interacts with the heads residing in different states,
this results in additional interference and some peaks in the X-ray pattern
should slacken or even extinct as compared with the pattern from the heads with
the continuous-type conformation. The formulas describing both cases are
compared in this article. In general, the distinction between X-ray patterns is
insignificant, but they could be appreciably different at some stages of
conformation process (respective lever arm position depends on the type of
discrete model). Consequently, one can with luck attempt to find out this
difference using a high-sensitive equipment.

1603.02062,2016-03-08,"Extracellular stimulation of nerve cells with electric current spikes
  induced by voltage steps","  A new stimulation paradigm is presented for the stimulation of nerve cells by
extracellular electric currents. In the new paradigm stimulation is achieved
with the current spike induced by a voltage step whenever the voltage step is
applied to a live biological tissue. By experimental evidence and theoretical
arguments, it is shown that this spike is well suited for the stimulation of
nerve cells. Stimulation of the human tongue is used for proof of principle.
Charge injection thresholds are measured for various voltages. The time-profile
of the current spike used in the experiment has a half-width of about 1
microsecond. The decay of the spike is non-exponential. The spike has at least
three distinctly different phases. A Maxwell phase is followed by a
charge-rearrangement phase. Charging of cell membranes is completed in a third
phase. All three phases contribute to depolarization or hyperpolarization of
cell membranes. Due to the short duration of the spike the charge transfer is
very small. The activation time (time of no return) of nerve cell membranes
leading to an action potential is measured and found to be unexpectedly short.
It can become as short as 3 microseconds for a voltage step of 10 V or higher.

1603.04429,2016-06-15,Birdsong dialect patterns explained using magnetic domains,"  The songs and calls of many bird species, like human speech, form distinct
regional dialects. We suggest that the process of dialect formation is
analogous to the physical process of magnetic domain formation. We take the
coastal breeding grounds of the Puget Sound white crowned sparrow as an
example. Previous field studies suggest that birds of this species learn
multiple songs early in life, and when establishing a territory for the first
time, retain one of these dialects in order to match the majority of their
neighbours. We introduce a simple lattice model of the process, showing that
this matching behaviour can produce single dialect domains provided the death
rate of adult birds is sufficiently low. We relate death rate to thermodynamic
temperature in magnetic materials, and calculate the critical death rate by
analogy with the Ising model. Using parameters consistent with the known
behavior of these birds we show that coastal dialect domain shapes may be
explained by viewing them as low temperature ""stripe states"".

1605.00033,2020-05-22,A framework for philosophical biology,"  Advances in biology have mostly relied on theories that were subsequently
revised, expanded or eventually refuted using experimental and other means.
Theoretical biology used to primarily provide a basis to rationally examine the
frameworks within which biological experiments were carried out and to shed
light on overlooked gaps in understanding. Today, however, theoretical biology
has generally become synonymous with computational and mathematical biology.
This could in part be explained by a relatively recent tendency in which a
""data first"", rather than a ""theory first"", approach is preferred. Moreover,
generating hypotheses has at times become procedural rather than theoretical.
This situation leaves our understanding enmeshed in data, which should be
disentangled from much noise. Given the many unresolved questions in biology
and medicine, it seems apt to revive the role of pure theory in the biological
sciences. This paper makes the case for a ""philosophical biology""
(philbiology), distinct from but quite complementary to philosophy of biology
(philobiology), which would entail biological investigation through
philosophical approaches. Philbiology would thus be a reincarnation of
theoretical biology, adopting the true sense of the word ""theory"" and making
use of a rich tradition of serious philosophical approaches in the natural
sciences. A philbiological investigation, after clearly defining a given
biological problem, would aim to propose a set of empirical questions, along
with a class of possible solutions, about that problem. Importantly, whether or
not the questions can be tested using current experimental paradigms would be
secondary to whether the questions are inherently empirical or not. The final
goal of a philbiological investigation would be to develop a theoretical
framework that can lead observational and/or interventional experimental
studies of the defined problem.

1605.01893,2016-05-09,"Metric dynamics for membrane transformation through regulated cell
  proliferation","  This study develops an equation for describing three-dimensional membrane
transformation through proliferation of its component cells regulated by
morphogen density distributions on the membrane. The equation is developed in a
two-dimensional coordinate system mapped on the membrane, referred to as the
membrane coordinates. When the membrane expands, the membrane coordinates
expand in the same manner so that the membrane is invariant in the coordinates.
In the membrane coordinate system, the transformation of membrane is described
with a time-derivative equation for metric tensors. By defining relationships
between morphogen density distributions and the direction and rate of cell
division, trajectories of membrane transformation are obtained in terms of the
morphogen distributions. An example of the membrane transformation is shown
numerically.

chain. I have shared instructions to make your own polypeptide chain and STL
files of Peppytides in MAKE magazine in Jan 2014 issue. However, Peppytides
involves a lot of steps and assembly of units. People were asking me, 'Is there
any easier way to make these models?'. I have been at several workshops,
hands-on sessions, talks and a science events with Peppytides. From the
feedback that I got everywhere, most of the makers, teachers and students want
something that is 3D-Print-&-Go, or at least easier to make, even at the cost
of some features.
  I have designed a new version of the model, named PeppyChains, in which the
backbone chain of the model can be 3d-printed as a single unit. PeppyChains
design eliminates the assembling of parts to form the backbone chain, but with
the cost of losing the ability to use bias-magnets to favor certain phi/psi
angles in the backbone. I have been demonstrating PeppyChains at various talks
and workshops along with Peppytides, and I have received requests for making
the STL file public. On popular demand, here I am sharing this STL and

1605.05419,2021-08-23,An Introduction to Programming for Bioscientists: A Python-based Primer,"  Computing has revolutionized the biological sciences over the past several
decades, such that virtually all contemporary research in the biosciences
utilizes computer programs. The computational advances have come on many
fronts, spurred by fundamental developments in hardware, software, and
algorithms. These advances have influenced, and even engendered, a phenomenal
array of bioscience fields, including molecular evolution and bioinformatics;
genome-, proteome-, transcriptome- and metabolome-wide experimental studies;
structural genomics; and atomistic simulations of cellular-scale molecular
assemblies as large as ribosomes and intact viruses. In short, much of
post-genomic biology is increasingly becoming a form of computational biology.
The ability to design and write computer programs is among the most
indispensable skills that a modern researcher can cultivate. Python has become
a popular programming language in the biosciences, largely because (i) its
straightforward semantics and clean syntax make it a readily accessible first
language; (ii) it is expressive and well-suited to object-oriented programming,
as well as other modern paradigms; and (iii) the many available libraries and
third-party toolkits extend the functionality of the core language into
virtually every biological domain (sequence and structure analyses,
phylogenomics, workflow management systems, etc.). This primer offers a basic
introduction to coding, via Python, and it includes concrete examples and
exercises to illustrate the language's usage and capabilities; the main text
culminates with a final project in structural bioinformatics. A suite of
Supplemental Chapters is also provided. Starting with basic concepts, such as
that of a 'variable', the Chapters methodically advance the reader to the point
of writing a graphical user interface to compute the Hamming distance between
two DNA sequences.

1605.05681,2016-05-19,Contiguity is limited in free recall,"  Does the ""law of contiguity"" apply to free recall? I find that conditional
response probabilities, often used as evidence for contiguity in free recall,
have been displayed insufficiently, limiting the distance from the last item
recalled, and only averaged over all items. When fully expanding the x-axis and
examining the conditional response probabilities separately for the beginning,
middle and end of the presented item list, I show that the law of contiguity
applies only locally, even then only sometimes, and breaks down globally.
"
1605.05682,2016-05-19,Large individual differences in free recall,"  Using single factor ANOVA I show that there are large individual differences
in free recall ({\eta} ranges from 0.09-0.26) including the total recall, the
balance between recency and primacy, and the initial recall (subsequent recalls
show smaller individual differences). All three memory properties are
relatively uncorrelated. The variance in the initial position may be a measure
of executive control and is correlated with total recall (the smaller the
variation, the larger the recall).
"
1605.05684,2016-05-19,"Conditional Response Probabilities Confirm Two Stages of Free Recall,
  Working Memory Very Localized, Second Stage Delocalized, Both with Strong
  Tendencies to Forward Subsequent Recalls","  Recently it was shown that free recall consists of two stages: the first few
recalls empty working memory and a second stage concludes the recall (Tarnow,
2015; for a review of the theoretical prediction see Murdock, 1974). Here I
investigate conditional response probabilities in Murdock's 40-1 (1962) free
recall dataset. I find that the conditional response probabilities confirm the
presence of two stages. The first stage is characterized by a large enhancement
of the forward subsequent recall (up to 30 times chance) and a large
suppression of backward recalls (up to 26 times smaller than chance for recalls
between 10 and 40 items away). The second stage forward subsequent recall is
enhanced by a factor of 5 and the probability of backward and forward recalls
are concentrated at small distances. Thus both stages favor forward subsequent
recalls. As in Tarnow (2015), the first stage is much more localized than the
second stage. Working memory capacity is estimated in six ways to be about 4.5
word items for the 40-1 word list.
"
1605.05685,2016-05-19,"First direct evidence of two stages in free recall and three
  corresponding estimates of working memory capacity","  I find that exactly two stages can be seen directly in sequential free recall
distributions. These distributions show that the first three recalls come from
the emptying of working memory, recalls 6 and above come from a second stage
and the 4th and 5th recalls are mixtures of the two. A discontinuity, a rounded
step function, is shown to exist in the fitted linear slope of the recall
distributions as the recall shifts from the emptying of working memory
(positive slope) to the second stage (negative slope). The discontinuity leads
to a first estimate of the capacity of working memory at 4-4.5 items. Working
memory accounts for the recency effect. The primacy effect comes from the
second stage with a contribution also from working memory for short lists (the
first item). The different slopes of the working memory and secondary stages,
and that the two have different functional forms, accounts for the u-shaped
serial position curve. The total recall is shown to be a linear combination of
the content of working memory and items recalled in the second stage with
3.0-3.9 items coming from working memory, a second estimate of the capacity of
working memory. A third, separate upper limit on the capacity of working memory
is found (3.06 items), corresponding to the requirement that the content of
working memory cannot exceed the total recall, item by item. This third limit
presumably corresponds to the least chunked item. This is the best limit on the
capacity of unchunked working memory.
"
1605.05686,2016-05-19,"Free Recall Shows Similar Reactivation Behavior as Recognition & Cued
  Recall","  I find that the total retrieval time in word free recall increases linearly
with the total number of items recalled. Measured slopes, the time to retrieve
an additional item, vary from 1.4-4.5 seconds per item depending upon
presentation rate, subject age and whether there is a delay after list
presentation or not. These times to retrieve an additional item obey a second
linear relationship as a function of the recall probability averaged over the
experiment, explicitly independent of subject age, presentation rate and
whether there is a delay after the list presentation or not. This second linear
relationship mimics the relationships in recognition and cued recall (Tarnow,
2008) which suggests that free recall retrieval uses the same reactivation
mechanism as recognition or cued recall. Extrapolation limits the time to
retrieve an additional item to a maximum of 7.2 seconds per item if the
probability of recall is near 0%. Earlier upper limits for recognition and cued
recall varied with the item type between 0.2 and 1.8 seconds per item (Tarnow,
2008). Implications include that there are only two types of short term memory:
working memory and reactivation.

1605.05687,2016-05-19,"Direct Evidence Delay with A Task Decreases Working Memory Content in
  Free Recall","  Recently it was shown that free recall consists of two stages: the first few
recalls empty the working memory and a second stage concludes the recall
(Tarnow, 2015; for a review of the theoretical prediction see Murdock, 1974).
It is commonly believed that a delay with a task before the recall starts
removes the content of working memory (Glanzer & Cunitz, 1966). Here is
presented the first direct evidence that this is indeed the case.
"
1605.05688,2016-05-19,"A Precise Measure of Working Memory Reveals Subjects Difficulties
  Managing Limited Capacity","  Free recall consists of two separate stages: the emptying of working memory
and reactivation [1]. The Tarnow Unchunkable Test (TUT, [2]) uses double
integer items to separate out only the first stage by making it difficult to
reactivate items due to the lack of intra-item relationships. 193 Russian
college students were tested via the internet version of the TUT. The average
number of items remembered in the 3 item test was 2.54 items. In the 4 item
test, the average number of items decreased to 2.38. This, and a number of
other qualitative distribution differences between the 3 and 4 item tests,
indicates that the average capacity limit of working memory has been reached at
3 items. This provides the first direct measurement of the unchunkable capacity
limit of language based items. That the average number of items remembered
decreased as the number of items increased from 3 to 4 indicates that most
subjects were unable to manage their working memories as the number of items
increased just beyond the average capacity. Further evidence for the difficulty
in managing the capacity limit is that 25% of subjects could not remember any
items correctly at least in one of three 4 item tests and that the Pearson
correlation between the 3 item and 4 item subject recalls was a relatively
small 38%. This failure of managing a basic memory resource should have
important consequences for pedagogy including instruction, text book design and
test design. Because working memory scores are important for academic
achievement, it also suggests that an individual can gain academically by
learning how to manage her or his capacity limit.

fraction of a second. Study Design: This study is a combination of field
interviews, online surveys and automatic database search. Methods: We asked
open-ended questions to farmers who know the worms, consulted experts and
searched the Internet to document folkloric and artistic instances using all
the names that these animals receive in English, Spanish and Portuguese
(languages of the countries where they occur) as well as other languages, and
automatic image search, in Web of Science, CrossRef, Google Scholar and Google.
Results: We found more than 80 cases of direct references to velvet worms in
folklore and art, mostly from the USA, Australia, Brazil, Costa Rica and New
Zealand. Per capita the countries with more cases are New Zealand (24 cases per
million inhabitants), Costa Rica (16 cases per million inhabitants) and
Australia (3 cases per million inhabitants). The most frequent expressions are
cartoons, followed by tourism agencies using velvet worms in their ads,
products with velvet worm representations, folkloric beliefs, and music bands
or songs named after them. In almost all cases the animals are seen in a
favorable light, inspiring folklore and art that highlight their extraordinary
nature. Conclusion: The unique prey capture mechanism of velvet worms seems to
have inspired an unexpected number of artistic and folkloric expressions,
preserved for the future in the present article, which starts a totally new
line of research: the effect of ""living fossils"" on human culture.

1606.03482,2016-06-14,Study of human accessibility: physical tests versus numerical simulation,"  Consideration of physical dimensions of the user population is essential to
design adapted environment. This variability in body dimensions (called
""anthropometry"") is involved in design tools commonly used today to assess
user's accommodation (physical mock-ups, population models, database, boundary
manikins, hybrid methods or digital human modeling). Databases are created from
campaigns of measurement. Besides the fact that such measures are costly in
time and money, they give more ""static"" measures of man. They do not take into
account possible stretching limbs that could allow increased accessibility.
This paper presents a methodology for human body modeling, in a dynamic way,
not static. The methodology allows to highlight influences of design and human
behaviour on reach skills, directly induced by the interaction with real
prototypes and not just considered by human physical dimensions. The first part
of the method is to create a database of measurements (arms length, hip
breadth, etc.). From these data, a model of accessibility is proposed. The
accessibility field is determined purely numerically. In parallel, an
experiment is set up to measure the extension of the accessibility field, with
the same people. A comparison of the results is then performed and a new model
of the human body is proposed.

1606.03620,2016-06-14,Modelling Early Transitions Toward Autonomous Protocells,"  This thesis broadly concerns the origins of life problem, pursuing a joint
approach that combines general philosophical/conceptual reflection on the
problem along with more detailed and formal scientific modelling work oriented
in the conceptual perspective developed. The central subject matter addressed
is the emergence and maintenance of compartmentalised chemistries as precursors
of more complex systems with a proper cellular organization. Whereas an
evolutionary conception of life dominates prebiotic chemistry research and
overflows into the protocells field, this thesis defends that the 'autonomous
systems perspective' of living phenomena is a suitable - arguably the most
suitable - conceptual framework to serve as a backdrop for protocell research.
The autonomy approach allows a careful and thorough reformulation of the
origins of cellular life problem as the problem of how integrated autopoietic
chemical organisation, present in all full-fledged cells, originated and
developed from more simple far-from-equilibrium chemical aggregate systems.

1606.07779,2016-06-27,Natural calcium carbonate for biomedical applications,"  Sea shells are found to be a very rich natural resource for calcium
carbonate. Sea shells are made up of CaCO3 mainly in the aragonite form, which
are columnar or fibrous or microsphere structured crystals. The bioactivity of
nanoparticles of sea shell has been studied in this work. The sea shells
collected were thoroughly washed, dried and pulverized. The powder was sieved
and particles in the range of 45 to 63 microns were collected. The powdered sea
shells were characterized using X-Ray Diffraction and Field Emission Scanning
Electron Microscopy. The XRD data showed that the particles were mainly
microspheres. Traces of calcite and vaterite were also present. Experiments
were conducted to study the aspirin and strontium ranelate drug loading into
the sea shell powder using soak and dry method. Different concentrations of
drug solution was made in ethanol and water. The shell powder was soaked in
drug solutions and was kept soaking for 48 hrs with intermittent
ultrasonication. The mixture was gently dried in a vacuum oven. The in vitro
drug release studies were done using Phosphate Buffered Saline. The FESEM
images displayed a distribution of differently sized and shaped particles. The
sea shells due to its natural porosity and crystallinity are expected to be
useful for drug delivery. About 50% drug entrapment efficiency for aspirin and
39% for strontium ranelate was seen. A burst release of the drug (80 percent)
was observed within two hours for both the drugs studied. Rest of the drug was
released slowly in 19 hrs. Further modification of the sea shell with non toxic
polymers is also planned as a part of this work. Sea shell powder has become a
potential candidate for drug delivery due to all the aforementioned advantages.

1607.00561,2018-05-24,Selfish Pups: Weaning Conflict and Milk Theft in Free-Ranging Dogs,"  Parent-offspring conflict theory predicts the emergence of weaning conflict
between a mother and her offspring arising from skewed relatedness benefits.
Empirical observations of weaning conflict has not been carried out in canids.
In a field-based study on free-ranging dogs we observed that suckling bout
durations reduce, proportion of mother-initiated suckling bouts reduce and
mother-initiated suckling terminations increase, with pup age. We identified
the 7th - 13th week period of pup age as the zone of conflict between the
mother and her pups, beyond which suckling solicitations cease, and before
which suckling refusals are few. We also report for the first time milk theft
by pups who take advantage of the presence of multiple lactating females, due
to the promiscuous mating system of the dogs. This behaviour, though apparently
disadvantageous for the mothers, is perhaps adaptive for the dogs in the face
of high mortality and competition for resources.

  free-ranging dogs","  Mammalian offspring require parental care, at least in the form of suckling
during their early development. While mothers need to invest considerable time
and energy in ensuring the survival of their current offspring, they also need
to optimize their investment in one batch of offspring in order to ensure
future reproduction and hence lifetime reproductive success. Free-ranging dogs
live in small social groups, mate promiscuously, and lack the cooperative
breeding biology of other group living canids. They face high early life
mortality, which in turn reduces fitness benefits of the mother from a batch of
pups. We carried out a field based study on free-ranging dogs in India to
understand the nature of parental care provided by mothers at different stages
of pup development. Using behavioural patterns of mother-pup interactions, we
draw up a timeline of pup ontogeny. Our analysis reveals that mothers cleverly
reduce investment in energy intensive active care and increase passive care as
the pups grow older, thereby keeping overall levels of parental care more or
less constant over pup age.

1607.01138,2018-05-24,"Do dogs live in joint families? Understanding allo-parental care in
  free-ranging dogs","  Cooperative breeding is an excellent example of altruistic cooperation in
social groups. Domestic dogs have evolved from cooperatively hunting and
breeding ancestors, but have adapted to a facultatively social scavenging
lifestyle on streets, and solitary living in human homes. Pets typically breed
and reproduce under human supervision, but free-ranging dogs can provide
insights into the natural breeding biology of dogs. We conducted a five year
long study on parental care of free-ranging dogs in India. We observed
widespread alloparenting by both adult males and females. Allomothers provided
significantly less care that the mothers, but the putative fathers showed
comparable levels of care with the mothers. However, the nature of care varied;
mothers invested more effort in feeding and allogrooming, while the putative
fathers played and protected more. We were unsure of the relatedness of the
pups with the putative fathers, but all the allomothers were maternal relatives
of the pups, which provides support for both the benefit-of-philopatry and
assured fitness returns hypotheses. Free-ranging dogs are not cooperative
breeders like wolves, but are more similar to communal breeders. Their breeding
biology bears interesting similarities with the human joint family system.

1607.04502,2016-07-18,Stem Cell Networks,"  We present a general computational theory of stem cell networks and their
developmental dynamics. Stem cell networks are special cases of developmental
control networks. Our theory generates a natural classification of all possible
stem cell networks based on their network architecture. Each stem cell network
has a unique topology and semantics and developmental dynamics that result in
distinct phenotypes. We show that the ideal growth dynamics of multicellular
systems generated by stem cell networks have mathematical properties related to
the coefficients of Pascal's Triangle. The relationship to cancer stem cells
and their control networks is indicated. The theory lays the foundation for a
new research paradigm for understanding and investigating stem cells. The
theory of stem cell networks implies that new methods for generating and
controlling stem cells will become possible.

  Complexity for Low-High Infection Level Intracellular Viral Reaction Kinetics","  Viral infectious diseases, such as HIV virus growth, cause an important
health concern. Study of intracellular viral processes can provide us to
develop drug and understanding the drug dose to decrease the HIV virus in
during growth. Kinetics Monte Carlo simulation has been done for solving Master
equation about dynamics of intracellular viral reaction kinetics. Scaling
relationship between equilibrium time and initial population of template has
been found as power low, , where N , are the number of initial population of
template species , equilibrium time, a = 163.1 , b = -0.1429 respectively.
Stochastic dynamics shows that increasing initial population of template
decreases the time of equilibrium. Entropy generation has been considered in
low, intermediate and high infection level of intracellular viral kinetics
reaction in during dynamical process. Permutation, multi scaling and modified
multiscaling entropies have been calculated for three kinds of species in
intracellular reaction dynamics, genome, structural protein, and template. Our
result shows that presence of noise in dynamical process of intracellular
reaction will change order of permutation entropy for the mentioned of three
species. In addition to multiscaling entropy is computed for mentioned model
and it has the following order: template > structural protein> genome.
Dependency of permutation entropy result to permutation order becomes small in
high infection level in intracellular viral kinetics dynamics. At short time
scale in intracellular reaction dynamics, convergency of permutation entropy
occurs with medium permutation order value. In the big time scale of
intracellular dynamics, permutation entropy scale with permutation order n as a
scaling relation .

qnumbers, is used to study the genetic code(s). After considering two kinds of
q-numbers, for comparison, a phenomenological classification scheme of the

Next, numbers describing the presence of additional amino acids, such as
Selenocysteine or/and Pyrrolysine, are also produced. Finally, a minimal number

1608.00539,2017-03-27,A Binary Representation of the Genetic Code,"  This article introduces a novel binary representation of the canonical
genetic code based on both the structural similarities of the nucleotides, as
well as the physicochemical properties of the encoded amino acids. Each of the
four mRNA bases is assigned a unique 2-bit identifier, so that the 64 triplet
codons are each indexed by a 6-bit label. The ordering of the bits reflects the
hierarchical organization manifested by the DNA replication/repair and tRNA
translation systems. In this system, transition and transversion mutations are
naturally expressed as binary operations, and the severities of the different
point mutations can be analyzed. Using a principal component analysis, it is
shown that the physicochemical properties of amino acids related to protein
folding also correlate with certain bit positions of their respective labels.
Thus, the likelihood for a point mutation to be conservative, and less likely
to cause a change in protein functionality, can be estimated.

  Languages Facilitate Building Complex and Flexible Bioinformatic Models","  We address the need for expanding the presence of the Lisp family of
programming languages in bioinformatics and computational biology research.
Languages of this family, like Common Lisp, Scheme, or Clojure, facilitate the
creation of powerful and flexible software models that are required for complex
and rapidly evolving domains like biology. We will point out several important
key features that distinguish languages of the Lisp family from other
programming languages and we will explain how these features can aid
researchers in becoming more productive and creating better code. We will also
show how these features make these languages ideal tools for artificial
intelligence and machine learning applications. We will specifically stress the
advantages of domain-specific languages (DSL): languages which are specialized
to a particular area and thus not only facilitate easier research problem
formulation, but also aid in the establishment of standards and best
programming practices as applied to the specific research field at hand. DSLs
are particularly easy to build in Common Lisp, the most comprehensive Lisp
dialect, which is commonly referred to as the ""programmable programming
language."" We are convinced that Lisp grants programmers unprecedented power to
build increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence systems that may
ultimately transform machine learning and AI research in bioinformatics and
computational biology.

  tie-points","  The discovery of past spikes in atmospheric radiocarbon activity, caused by
major solar energetic particle events, has opened up new possibilities for
high-precision chronometry. The two spikes, or Miyake Events, have now been
widely identified in tree-rings that grew in the years 775 and 994 CE.
Furthermore, all other plant material that grew in these years would also have
incorporated the anomalously high concentrations of radiocarbon. Crucially,
some plant-based artefacts, such as papyrus documents, timber beams and linen
garments, can also be allocated to specific positions within long, currently
unfixed, historical sequences. Thus, Miyake Events represent a new source of
tie-points that could provide the means for anchoring early chronologies to the
absolute timescale. Here, we explore this possibility, outlining the most
expeditious approaches, the current challenges and obstacles, and how they
might best be overcome.

1609.01566,2016-09-07,"The Complexity of Molecular Interactions and Bindings between Cyclic
  Peptide and Inhibit Polymerase A and B1 (PAC-PB1N) H1N1","  The influenza/H1N1 virus has caused hazard in the public health of many
countries. Hence, existing influenza drugs could not cope with H1N1 infection
due to the high mutation rate of the virus. In this respect, new method to
block the virus was devised. The polymerase PAC-PB1N enzyme is responsible for
the replication of H1N1 virus. Thus, novel inhibitors were developed to ward
off the functionality of the enzyme. In this research, cyclic peptides has been
chosen to inhibit PAC-PB1N due to its proven stability in reaching the drug
target. Thus, computational method for elucidating the molecular interaction
between cyclic peptides and PAC-PB1N has been developed by using the LigX tools
from MOE 2008.10 software. The tools could render the bindings that involved in
the interactions. The interactions between individual amino acid in the
inhibitor and enzyme could be seen as well. Thus, the peptide sequences of
CKTTC and CKKTC were chosen as the lead compounds. In this end, the feasibility
of cyclic peptides to act as drug candidate for H1N1 could be exposed by the 2d
and 3d modeling of the molecular interactions.

1609.02141,2016-09-09,Correlations in Usage Frequencies and Shannon Entropy for Codons,"  The usage frequencies for codons belonging to quartets are analized, over the
whole exonic region, for 92 biological species. Correlation is put into
evidence, between the usage frequencies of synonymous codons with third
nucleotide A and C and between the usage frequencies of non synonymous codons,
belonging to suitable subsets of the quartets, with the same third nucleotide.
A correlation is pointed out between amino acids belonging to subsets of the
set encoded by quartets of codons. It is remarked that the computed Shannon
entropy for quartets is weakly dependent on the biological species. The
observed correlations well fit in the mathematical scheme of the crystal basis
model of the genetic code.

continue with more complex chemical, biological, life and social and technical

"
1609.09175,2016-10-20,Conservation of Charge and Conservation of Current,"  Conservation of current and conservation of charge are nearly the same thing:
when enough is known about charge movement, conservation of current can be
derived from conservation of charge, in ideal dielectrics, for example.
Conservation of current is enforced implicitly in ideal dielectrics by theories
that conserve charge. But charge movement in real materials like semiconductors
or ionic solutions is never ideal. We present an apparently universal
derivation of conservation of current and advocate using that conservation law
explicitly as a distinct part of theories and calculations of charge movement
in complex fluids and environments. Classical models using ordinary
differential equations rarely satisfy conservation of current, including the
chemical kinetic models implementing the law of mass action and Markov models.
These models must be amended if they are to conserve current. Strict
enforcement of conservation of current is likely to aid numerical analysis by
preventing artifactual accumulation of charge.

1609.09421,2023-11-14,"Physical mechanisms influencing life origin and development.
  Physical-biochemical paradigm of Life","  The present view of biological phenomena is based on a biochemical paradigm
that development of living organisms is defined by information stored in a
molecular form as some genetic code. However, new discoveries indicate that
biological phenomena cannot be confined to a biochemical realm alone, but are
also influenced by physical mechanisms. These mechanisms work at cellular,
organ and whole organism spatial levels. They impose uniquely defined
constraints on distribution of nutrients between biomass synthesis and
maintenance of existing biomass, thus influencing the composition of
biochemical reactions, their successive change and irreversibility during the
organismal life cycle. Mathematically, such a growth mechanism is represented
by a growth equation. Using this equation, we introduce growth models, show
their adequacy to experimental data, and discover two types of division
mechanisms, examining growth of unicellular organisms Amoeba, S. pombe, E.
coli, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus. Also, on the basis of the growth equation,
we find different metabolic characteristics of these organisms. For instance,
it was shown that in logarithmic coordinates the values of their metabolic
allometric exponents are located on a straight line. This fact has important
implications with regard to evolutionary process of organisms within a food
chain, considered as a single system. High adequateness of obtained results to
experimental data, from different perspectives, as well as excellent compliance
with previously proven more particular knowledge, and with general criteria for
validation of scientific truths, proves validity of the introduced general
growth mechanism and the growth equation. Taken together, the obtained results
set solid grounds for introduction of a more comprehensive physical-biochemical
paradigm of Life origin, development and evolution.

DNA are inverted, moved, swapped, or even inserted or deleted, have found a
natural syntax in the language of permutations. Despite this, there has been a
wide range of modelling choices, assumptions and interpretations that make
navigating the literature a significant challenge. Indeed, even authors of
papers that use permutations to model genome rearrangement can struggle to
interpret each others' work, because of subtle differences in basic assumptions
that are often deeply ingrained (and consequently sometimes not even
mentioned). In this paper, we describe the different ways in which permutations
have been used to model genomes and genome rearrangement events, presenting
some features and limitations of each approach, and show how the various models
are related. This paper will help researchers navigate the landscape of genome
rearrangement models, and make it easier for authors to present clear and
consistent models.

psychosocial benefits of mealtime, great advancements in nutritional sciences
for support of human space travel have occurred over the past 60 years.
Nutrition in space has many areas of impact, including provision of required
nutrients and maintenance of endocrine, immune, and musculoskeletal systems. It
is affected by environmental conditions such as radiation, temperature, and
atmospheric pressures, and these are reviewed. Nutrition with respect to space
flight is closely interconnected with other life sciences research disciplines
including the study of hematology, immunology, as well as neurosensory,
cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, circadian rhythms, and musculoskeletal
physiology. Psychosocial aspects of nutrition are also important for more
productive missions and crew morale. Research conducted to determine the impact
of spaceflight on human physiology and subsequent nutritional requirements will
also have direct and indirect applications in Earth-based nutrition research.
Cumulative nutritional research over the past five decades has resulted in the
current nutritional requirements for astronauts. Realization of the full role
of nutrition during spaceflight is critical for the success of
extended-duration missions. Long-duration missions will require quantitation of
nutrient requirements for maintenance of health and protection against the
effects of microgravity.

1610.01404,2016-10-06,"Why cells grow and divide? General growth mechanism and how it defines
  cells' growth, reproduction and metabolic properties","  We consider a general growth mechanism, which acts at cellular level and
above (organs, systems and whole organisms). Using its mathematical
representation, the growth equation, we study the growth and division
mechanisms of amoeba and fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We show how
this mechanism, together with biomolecular machinery, governs growth and
reproduction of cells, and these organisms in particular. This mechanism
provides revealing answers to fundamental questions of biology, like why cells
grow and divide, why and when cells' growth stops. It also sheds light on
questions like why and how life originated and developed. Solving the growth
equation, we obtain analytical expression for the growth curve of fission yeast
as a function of geometrical characteristics and nutrient influxes for RNA and
protein synthesis, and compare the computed growth curves with 85 experiments.
Statistical evaluation shows that these growth curves correspond to
experimental data significantly better than all previous approximations. Also,
using the general growth mechanism, we show how metabolic characteristics of
cells, their size and evolutionary traits relate, considering fission yeast. In
particular, we found that fission yeast S. pombe consumes about 16-18 times
more nutrients for maintenance needs than for biomass synthesis.

1610.02448,2016-10-11,A topological approach to the problem of emergence in complex systems,"  Emergent patterns in complex systems are related to many intriguing phenomena
in modern science and philosophy. Several conceptions such as weak, strong and
robust emergence have been proposed to emphasize different epistemological and
ontological aspects of the problem. One of the most important concerns is
whether emergence is an intrinsic property of the reality we observe, or it is
rather a consequence of epistemological limitations. To elucidate this
question, we propose a novel approximation through constructive topology, a
framework that allow us to map the space of observed objects (ontology) with
the knowledge subject conceptual apparatus (epistemology). Focusing in a
particular type of emergent processes, namely those accessible through
experiments and from which we have still no clue on the mechanistic processes
yielding its formation, we analyse how a knowledge subject would build a
conceptual explanatory framework. Working on these systems, we identify concept
disjunction as a critical logical operation needed to identify the constraints
of the system. Next, focusing on a three-bits synthetic system, we show how the
number and scope of the constraints hinder the development of such scheme.
Interestingly, we observe that our framework is unable to identify global
constraints, clearly linking the epistemological limits of the framework with
an ontological feature of the system. This allows us to propose a definition of
emergence strength which we make compatible with the scientific method through
the active intervention of the observer on the system. We think that this
definition reconciles previous attempts to classify emergent processes, at
least for the specific kind we discuss here. The paper finishes discussing the
relevance of global constraints in biological systems, understood as a downward
causal influence exerted by natural selection.

  Structure, and Functionality","  Here we review the development of protein scaling theory, starting from
backgrounds in mathematics and statistical mechanics, and leading to biomedical
applications. Evolution has organized each protein family in different ways,
but scaling theory is both simple and effective in providing readily
transferable dynamical insights complementary for many proteins represented in
the 90 thousand static structures contained in the online Protein Data Base
(PDB). Scaling theory is a simplifying magic wand that enables one to search
the hundreds of millions of protein articles in the Web of Science, and
identify those proteins that present new cost-effective methods for early
detection and/or treatment of disease through individual protein sequences
(personalized medicine). Critical point theory is general, and recently it has
proved to be the most effective way of describing protein networks that have
evolved towards nearly perfect functionality in given environments
(self-organized criticality). Evolutionary patterns are governed by common
scaling principles, which can be quantified using scales that have been
developed bioinformatically by studying thousands of PDB structures. The most
effective scales involve either hydropathic globular sculpting interactions
averaged over length scales centered on membrane dimensions, or exposed beta
strand propensities associated with aggregative (strong) protein-protein
interactions.

  Germination Stage","  Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the seed
germination response of six Acacia species under different NaCl concentrations
in order to explore opportunities for selection and breeding salt tolerant
genotypes. Methodology: Germination of seeds was evaluated under salt stresses
using 5 treatment levels: 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mM of NaCl. Corrected
germination rate (GC), germination rate index (GRI) and mean germination time
(MGT) were recorded during 10 days. Results: The results indicated that
germination was significantly reduced in all species with the increase in NaCl
concentrations. However, significant interspecific variation for salt tolerance
was observed. The greatest variability in tolerance was observed at moderate
salt stress (200 mM of NaCl) and the decrease in germination appeared to be
more accentuated in A. cyanophylla and A. cyclops. Although, A. raddiana,
remains the most interesting, it preserved the highest percentage (GC = 80%)
and velocity of germination in all species studied in this study, even in the
high salt levels. This species exhibited a particular adaptability to salt
environment, at least at this stage in the life cycle and could be recommended
for plantation establishment in salt affected areas. On the other hand, when
ungerminated seeds were transferred from NaCl treatments to distilled water,
they recovered largely their germination without a lag period and with high
speed. This indicated that the germination inhibition was related to a
reversible osmotic stress that induced dormancy rather than specific ion
toxicity. Conclusion: This ability to germinate after exposure to higher
concentrations of NaCl suggests that studied species, especially the most
tolerant could be able to germinate under the salt affected soils and could be
utilized for the rehabilitation of damaged arid zones.

being approximately 60-70% higher than elderly Chinese; however the prevalence
F:M ratio was similar to elderly Chinese population. Patient data showed female
patients more often received treatment than men; and preliminary data show the
ratio of numbers of female patients received treatment compared with men did
not differ between Northeast Asians (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) and
European and American Caucasians, being around 2:1 in elderly population. The
existing data also suggest that menopause may be a contributing factor for the

  Aneurysms","  An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an enlargement of the abdominal aorta
which, if left untreated, can progressively widen and may rupture with fatal
consequences. In this paper, we determine an optimal treatment policy using
Markov decision process modeling. The policy is optimal with respect to the
number of quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) that are expected to be
accumulated during the remaining life of a patient. The new policy takes into
account factors that are ignored by the current clinical policy (e.g. the
life-expectancy and the age-dependent surgical mortality). The resulting
optimal policy is structurally different from the current policy. In
particular, the policy suggests that young patients with small aneurysms should
undergo surgery. The robustness of the policy structure is demonstrated using
simulations. A gain in the number of expected QALYs is shown, which indicates a
possibility of improved care for patients with AAAs.

have been filled up with fruit and vegetable residues. The anodes were realized
by means of a carbon fiber brush, while the cathodes were realized through a
graphite-based porous ceramic disk with Nafion membranes (117 Dupont). The
performances in terms of polarization curves and power production were assessed
according to different operating conditions: percentage of solid substrate
water dilution, adoption of freshwater and a 35mg/L NaCl water solution and,
finally, the effect of an initial potentiostatic growth.
  All TMFCs operated at low pH (pH$=3.0 \pm 0.5$), as no pH amendment was
carried out. Despite the harsh environmental conditions, our TMFCs showed a
Power Density (PD) ranging from 20 to 55~mW/m$^2 \cdot$kg$_{\text{waste}}$ and
a maximum CD of 20~mA/m$^2 \cdot$kg$_{\text{waste}}$, referred to the cathodic
surface. COD removal after a $28-$day period was about $45 \%$.
  The remarkably low pH values as well as the fouling of Nafion membrane very
likely limited TMFC performances. However, a scale-up estimation of our
reactors provides interesting values in terms of power production, compared to
actual anaerobic digestion plants. These results encourage further studies to
characterize the graphite-based porous ceramic cathodes and to optimize the
global TMFC performances, as they may provide a valid and sustainable

of germination rate. But by measuring the root tillers and the length, the
relative enzymatic activity, MDA, and the expression differences between gene
SoS2 and gene RD29b in the drought lower reaches, it is verified that the
mutagenized impatiens has more advantages than the normal impatiens, and it Can
further cultivate become drought resistance varieties impatiens. Conclusions:
In this experiment,which is a positive mutation, the mutagenized impatiens
improves drought resistance through radiative mutation. The so obtained
impatiens is more pleasing in sight in terms of color and shape and has higher
application value in garden virescence.

1611.05204,2017-06-02,The emergence and evolution of the research fronts in HIV/AIDS research,"  In this paper, we have identified and analyzed the emergence, structure and
dynamics of the paradigmatic research fronts that established the fundamentals
of the biomedical knowledge on HIV/AIDS. A search of papers with the
identifiers ""HIV/AIDS"", ""Human Immunodeficiency Virus"", ""HIV-1"" and ""Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome"" in the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), was carried
out. A citation network of those papers was constructed. Then, a sub-network of
the papers with the highest number of inter-citations (with a minimal in-degree
of 28) was selected to perform a combination of network clustering and text
mining to identify the paradigmatic research fronts and analyze their dynamics.
Thirteen research fronts were identified in this sub-network. The biggest and
oldest front is related to the clinical knowledge on the disease in the
patient. Nine of the fronts are related to the study of specific molecular
structures and mechanisms and two of these fronts are related to the
development of drugs. The rest of the fronts are related to the study of the
disease at the cellular level. Interestingly, the emergence of these fronts
occurred in successive ""waves"" over the time which suggest a transition in the
paradigmatic focus. The emergence and evolution of the biomedical fronts in
HIV/AIDS research is explained not just by the partition of the problem in
elements and interactions leading to increasingly specialized communities, but
also by changes in the technological context of this health problem and the
dramatic changes in the epidemiological reality of HIV/AIDS that occurred
between 1993 and 1995.

1611.09824,2016-11-30,"Interspecific allometric scaling of unicellular organisms as an
  evolutionary process of food chain creation","  Metabolism of living organisms is a foundation of life. The metabolic rate
(energy production per unit time) increases slower than organisms' mass. When
this phenomenon is considered across different species, it is called
interspecific allometric scaling, whose causes are unknown. We argue that the
cause of interspecific allometric scaling is the total effect of physiological
and adaptation mechanisms inherent to organisms composing a food chain.
Together, the workings of these mechanisms are united by a primary goal of any
living creature - its successful reproduction. This primary necessity of each
organism and of the entire food chain is that common denominator, to which all
organisms adjust their metabolic rates. In this article, we consider
unicellular organisms, while the second paper studies multicellular organisms
and the entire concept in more detail. Here, using the proposed concepts and
experimentally verified growth models of five different unicellular organisms,
we obtain close to experimental findings values of allometric exponents of
0.757 for the end of growth and 0.853 for the beginning of growth. These
results comply with experimental observations and prove our theory that the
requirement of successful reproduction within the food chain is an important
factor shaping interspecific allometric scaling.

1612.00036,2016-12-02,A quantitative definition of organismality and its application to lichen,"  The organism is a fundamental concept in biology. However there is no
universally accepted, formal, and yet broadly applicable definition of what an
organism is. Here we introduce a candidate definition. We adopt the view that
the ""organism"" is a functional concept, used by scientists to address
particular questions concerning the future state of a biological system, rather
than something wholly defined by that system. In this approach organisms are a
coarse-graining of a fine-grained dynamical model of a biological system.
Crucially, the coarse-graining of the system into organisms is chosen so that
their dynamics can be used by scientists to make accurate predictions of those
features of the biological system that interests them, and do so with minimal
computational burden. To illustrate our framework we apply it to a dynamic
model of lichen symbiosis---a system where either the lichen or its constituent
fungi and algae could reasonably be considered ""organisms."" We find that the
best choice for what organisms are in this scenario are complex mixtures of
many entities that do not resemble standard notions of organisms. When we
restrict our allowed coarse-grainings to more traditional types of organisms,
we find that ecological conditions, such as niche competition and predation
pressure, play a significant role in determining the best choice for organisms.

1612.00098,2024-10-08,"Metabolic allometric scaling of multicellular organisms as a product of
  evolutionary development and optimization of food chains","  Production of energy is a foundation of life. Metabolic rate of organisms
(amount of energy produced per unit time) generally increases slower than
organisms' mass, which has important implications for life organization. This
phenomenon, when considered across different taxa, is called interspecific
allometric scaling. Its origin has puzzled scientists for many decades, and
still is considered unknown. In this paper we posit that natural selection, as
determined by evolutionary pressures, leads to distribution of resources, and
accordingly energy, within a food chain, which is optimal from the perspective
of stability of the food chain, when each species has sufficient amount of
resources for continuous reproduction, but not too much to jeopardize existence
of other species. Metabolic allometric scaling is then a quantitative
representation of this optimal distribution. Taking locomotion and the primary
mechanism for distribution of energy, we developed a biomechanical model to
find energy expenditures, considering limb length, skeleton mass and speed.
Using the interspecific allometric exponents for these three measures and
substituting into the locomotion-derived model for energy expenditure, we
calculated allometric exponents for mammals, reptiles, fish and birds, and
compared these values with allometric exponents derived from experimental
observations. The calculated allometric exponents were nearly identical to
experimentally observed exponents for mammals, and very close for fish,
reptiles and the basal metabolic rate of birds. The main result of the study is
that the metabolic allometric scaling is a function of a mechanism of optimal
energy distribution between the species of a food chain. This optimized sharing
of common resources provides stability of a food chain for a given habitat and
is guided by evolutionary pressures and natural selection.

1612.02491,2016-12-09,Rethinking the Experiment,"  The crisis in the reproducibility of experiments invites a re-evaluation of
methods of inquiry and validation procedures. The text challenges current
assumptions of knowledge acquisition and introduces G-complexity for defining
decidable vs. non-decidable knowledge domains. A ""second Cartesian revolution,""
informed by and in awareness of anticipatory processes, should result in
scientific methods that transcend determinism and reductionism. Physics and
physics-based disciplines convincingly ascertained themselves by adequately
describing the non-living. A complementary perspective should account for the
specific causality characteristic of life by integrating past, present, and
future. Knowledge about anticipatory processes facilitates attainment of this
goal. Society cannot afford the dead-end street of reductionism. Science,
itself an expression of anticipatory activity, makes possible in our days
alternative understandings of reality and its dynamics.

1612.04682,2016-12-19,The design of a proto-animal brain based upon spike timing,"  A basal animal model is described as an organism similar to a Limpet that is
attached to the sea floor living in a reproductive community. Its brain model
uses logic cells (gates) to create a high frequency spike generator. Addition
logic cells create a timing framework based upon Pulse Width Modulation (PWM),
and create multi-cell, spike driven muscle actuators and bi-directional shift
registers that serve as memories. Together, these logic cells generate a pulse
train that forms a recurrent fractal in the form of coherent square waves that
consist of an equal number of set pulses and reset pulses. These pulses drive
the actuators that pump water and food through its shell. Some of these
individuals lose their permanent attachment to the sea floor, and evolve the
ability to move around using the feeding motions. This creates the hazard of
getting stuck against an object or moving away from its breeding community.
They evolve a sensor system and logic cells that produce a restoring motion for
each avoidance motion. This keeps the animal in the specific region of an
object that it encounters (hefting), and maintains the zero sum (coherence) of
the fractal, and connects the organism cyberneticly to objects that are sensed
in its environment. The logic units evolve to store permanent memories, and add
plus and minus pulse trains together into a single pulse train that allow the
animal to follow a moving object (imprinting). Additional logic units evolve
that allow the animal to heft using contacts with multiple objects that allow
the animal to return to its point of origin (reproductive migration) using
permanent memories that are created when a pulse is not reset to zero.So,
information is stored in multiple logic cells instead of a connection to one
logic cell, and is based upon spike timing rather than static (synaptic)
connections between cells.

1612.04695,2024-12-02,"Metabolic Allometric Scaling of Unicellular Organisms as a Product of
  Selection Guided by Optimization of Nutrients Distribution in Food Chains","  One of the major characteristics of living organisms is metabolic rate, which
is the amount of energy produced per unit of time. When the mass of organisms
increases, the metabolic rate also increases (usually as a power function of
mass), but usually slower than mass. This effect is called metabolic allometric
scaling. Its causes are considered unknown. The effect has important
implications for individual and population organismal development. It was shown
in the first part of this study, presented in a separate paper, that in the
case of multicellular organisms, this effect is a consequence of natural
selection and optimization of nutrient distribution between the species of a
food chain, sharing resources of a common habitat. Here, in the second part
that studies unicellular organisms, we discover that the same principle of
natural selection guided by optimization of nutrient distribution between the
species of a food chain defines also metabolic allometric scaling of
unicellular organisms. To find that, we consider the metabolic properties of
Amoeba proteus, fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Escherichia coli,
Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus. The sharing of nutrients is optimized in
such a way that bigger microorganisms have progressively bigger nutrient influx
per unit of surface. This evolutionary arrangement secures the stability of a
food chain by providing certain metabolic advantages for bigger organisms.
Accounting for this regular increase of nutrient influx with mass increase, we
obtained allometric exponents and their ranges close to experimental values,
thus proving that metabolic allometric scaling of both multicellular and
unicellular organisms is defined by the same fundamental evolutionary principle
of optimized sharing of nutrients between the species of a food chain.

1612.08742,2016-12-30,Flux ratios and channel structures,"  We investigate Ussing's unidirectional fluxes and flux ratios of charged
tracers motivated particularly by the insightful proposal of Hodgkin and Keynes
on a relation between flux ratios and channel structure. Our study is based on
analysis of quasi-one-dimensional Poisson-Nernst-Planck type models for ionic
flows through membrane channels. This class of models includes the Poisson
equation that determines the electrical potential from the charges present and
is in that sense consistent. Ussing's flux ratios generally depend on all
physical parameters involved in ionic flows, particularly, on bulk conditions
and channel structures. Certain setups of ion channel experiments result in
flux ratios that are universal in the sense that their values depend on bulk
conditions but not on channel structures; other setups lead to flux ratios that
are specific in the sense that their values depend on channel structures too.
Universal flux ratios could serve some purposes better than specific flux
ratios in some circumstances and worse in other circumstances. We focus on two
treatments of tracer flux measurements that serve as estimators of important
properties of ion channels. The first estimator determines the flux of the main
ion species from measurements of the flux of its tracer. Our analysis suggests
a better experimental design so that the flux ratio of the tracer flux and the
main ion flux is universal. The second treatment of tracer fluxes concerns
ratios of fluxes and experimental setups that try to determine some properties
of channel structure. We analyze the two widely used experimental designs of
estimating flux ratios and show that the most widely used method depends on the
spatial distribution of permanent charge so this flux ratio is specific and
thus allows estimation of (some of) the properties of that permanent charge,
even with ideal ionic solutions. ...

classification performance analysis, and a topical analysis concerning what
people are tweeting about four disease characteristics: symptoms, transmission,
prevention, and treatment. A combination of natural language processing and
machine learning techniques were used to determine what people are tweeting
about Zika. Specifically, a two-stage classifier system was built to find
relevant tweets on Zika, and then categorize these into the four disease

dirichlet allocation (LDA) to determine the five main tweet topics for each
disease characteristic. Results 1,234,605 tweets were collected. Tweets by
males and females were similar (28% and 23% respectively). The classifier
performed well on the training and test data for relevancy (F=0.87 and 0.99
respectively) and disease characteristics (F=0.79 and 0.90 respectively). Five
topics for each category were found and discussed with a focus on the symptoms
category. Through this process, we demonstrate how misinformation can be
discovered so that public health officials can respond to the tweets with
misinformation.

1702.03337,2017-09-15,"Modeling mammary organogenesis from biological first principles: Cells
  and their physical constraints","  In multicellular organisms, relations among parts and between parts and the
whole are contextual and interdependent. These organisms and their cells are
ontogenetically linked: an organism starts as a cell that divides producing
non-identical cells, which organize in tri-dimensional patterns. These
association patterns and cells types change as tissues and organs are formed.
This contextuality and circularity makes it difficult to establish detailed
cause and effect relationships. Here we propose an approach to overcome these
intrinsic difficulties by combining the use of two models; 1) an experimental
one that employs 3D culture technology to obtain the structures of the mammary
gland, namely, ducts and acini, and 2) a mathematical model based on biological
principles. The typical approach for mathematical modeling in biology is to
apply mathematical tools and concepts developed originally in physics or
computer sciences. Instead, we propose to construct a mathematical model based
on proper biological principles. Specifically, we use principles identified as
fundamental for the elaboration of a theory of organisms, namely i) the default
state of cell proliferation with variation and motility and ii) the principle
of organization by closure of constraints. This model has a biological
component, the cells, and a physical component, a matrix which contains
collagen fibers. Cells display agency and move and proliferate unless
constrained; they exert mechanical forces that i) act on collagen fibers and
ii) on other cells. As fibers organize, they constrain the cells on their
ability to move and to proliferate. The model exhibits a circularity that can
be interpreted in terms of closure of constraints...

For such interventions, a three-dimensional reactive transport model of

donor-metal interaction as well as donor-driven biomass growth and

1703.03432,2017-03-13,"Interest of Integrating Spaceborne LiDAR Data to Improve the Estimation
  of Biomass in High Biomass Forested Areas","  Mapping forest AGB (Above Ground Biomass) is of crucial importance to
estimate the carbon emissions associated with tropical deforestation. This
study proposes a method to overcome the saturation at high AGB values of
existing AGB map (Vieilledent's AGB map) by using a map of correction factors
generated from GLAS (Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) spaceborne LiDAR data.
The Vieilledent's AGB map of Madagascar was established using optical images,
with parameters calculated from the SRTM Digital Elevation Model, climatic
variables, and field inventories. In the present study, first, GLAS LiDAR data
were used to obtain a spatially distributed (GLAS footprints geolocation)
estimation of AGB (GLAS AGB) covering Madagascar forested areas, with a density
of 0.52 footprint/km 2. Second, the difference between the AGB from the
Vieilledent's AGB map and GLAS AGB at each GLAS footprint location was
calculated, and additional spatially distributed correction factors were
obtained. Third, an ordinary kriging interpolation was thus performed by taking
into account the spatial structure of these additional correction factors to
provide a continuous correction factor map. Finally, the existing and the
correction factor maps were summed to improve the Vieilledent's AGB map. The
results showed that the integration of GLAS data improves the precision of
Vieilledent's AGB map by approximately 7 t/ha. By integrating GLAS data, the
RMSE on AGB estimates decreases from 81 t/ha (R 2 = 0.62) to 74.1 t/ha (R 2 =
0.71). Most importantly, we showed that this approach using LiDAR data avoids
underestimating high biomass values (new maximum AGB of 650 t/ha compared to
550 t/ha with the first approach).

1703.03787,2017-03-13,A new integrated symmetrical table for genetic codes,"  Degeneracy is a salient feature of genetic codes, because there are more
codons than amino acids. The conventional table for genetic codes suffers from
an inability of illustrating a symmetrical nature among genetic base codes. In
fact, because the conventional wisdom avoids the question, there is little
agreement as to whether the symmetrical nature actually even exists. A better
understanding of symmetry and an appreciation for its essential role in the
genetic code formation can improve our understanding of nature coding
processes. Thus, it is worth formulating a new integrated symmetrical table for
genetic codes, which is presented in this paper. It could be very useful to
understand the Nobel laureate Crick wobble hypothesis: how one transfer
ribonucleic acid can recognize two or more synonymous codons, which is an
unsolved fundamental question in biological science.

1704.00940,2017-04-05,Symmetry and Minimum Principle at the Basis of the Genetic Code,"  The importance of the notion of symmetry in physics is well established:
could it also be the case for the genetic code? In this spirit, a model for the
Genetic Code based on continuous symmetries and entitled the ""Crystal Basis
Model"" has been proposed a few years ago. The present paper is a review of the
model, of some of its first applications as well as of its recent developments.
Indeed, after a motivated presentation of our mathematical model, we illustrate
its pertinence by applying it for the elaboration and verification of sum rules
for codon usage probabilities, as well as for establishing relations and some
predictions between physical-chemical properties of amino-acids. Then, defining
in this context a ""bio-spin"" structure for the nucleotides and codons, the
interaction between a couple of codon-anticodon can simply be represented by a
(bio) spin-spin potential. This approach will constitute the second part of the
paper where, imposing the minimum energy principle, an analysis of the
evolution of the genetic code can be performed with good agreement with the
generally accepted scheme. A more precise study of this interaction model
provides informations on codon bias, consistent with data.

1705.03322,2017-08-15,An applied mathematician's perspective on Rosennean Complexity,"  The theoretical biologist Robert Rosen developed a highly original approach
for investigating the question ""What is life?"", the most fundamental problem of
biology. Considering that Rosen made extensive use of mathematics it might seem
surprising that his ideas have only rarely been implemented in mathematical
models. On the one hand, Rosen propagates relational models that neglect
underlying structural details of the components and focus on relationships
between the elements of a biological system, according to the motto ""throw away
the physics, keep the organisation"". Rosen's strong rejection of mechanistic
models that he implicitly associates with a strong form of reductionism might
have deterred mathematical modellers from adopting his ideas for their own
work. On the other hand Rosen's presentation of his modelling framework, (M,R)
systems, is highly abstract which makes it hard to appreciate how this approach
could be applied to concrete biological problems. In this article, both the
mathematics as well as those aspects of Rosen's work are analysed that relate
to his philosophical ideas. It is shown that Rosen's relational models are a
particular type of mechanistic model with specific underlying assumptions
rather than a different kind of model that excludes mechanistic models. The
strengths and weaknesses of relational models are investigated by comparison
with current network biology literature. Finally, it is argued that Rosen's
definition of life, ""organisms are closed to efficient causation"", should be
considered as a hypothesis to be tested and ideas how this postulate could be
implemented in mathematical models are presented.

1705.03460,2018-02-07,A Probabilistic Framework for Quantifying Biological Complexity,"  One thing that discriminates living things from inanimate matter is their
ability to generate similarly complex or non-random architectures in a large
abundance. From DNA sequences to folded protein structures, living cells,
microbial communities and multicellular structures, the material configurations
in biology can easily be distinguished from non-living material assemblies.
This is also true of the products of complex organisms that can themselves
construct complex tools, machines, and artefacts. Whilst these objects are not
living, they cannot randomly form, as they are the product of a biological
organism and hence are either technological or cultural biosignatures. The
problem is that it is not obvious how it might be possible to generalise an
approach that aims to evaluate complex objects as possible biosignatures.
However, if it was possible such a self-contained approach could be useful to
explore the cosmos for new life forms. This would require us to prove
rigorously that a given artefact is too complex to have formed by chance. In
this paper, we present a new type of complexity measure, Pathway Complexity,
that allows us to not only threshold the abiotic-biotic divide, but to
demonstrate a probabilistic approach based upon object abundance and complexity
which can be used to unambiguously assign complex objects as biosignatures. We
hope that this approach not only opens up the search for biosignatures beyond
earth, but allow us to explore earth for new types of biology, as well as
observing when a complex chemical system discovered in the laboratory could be
considered alive.

  of pig herd antimicrobial exposure based on data from the Danish Veterinary
  Medicines Statistics Program (VetStat)","  With the increasing occurrence of antimicrobial resistance, more attention
has been directed towards surveillance of both human and veterinary
antimicrobial use. Since the early 2000s, several research papers on Danish pig
antimicrobial usage have been published, based on data from the Danish
Veterinary Medicines Statistics Program (VetStat). VetStat was established in
2000, as a national database containing detailed information on purchases of
veterinary medicine. This paper presents a critical set of challenges
originating from static system features, which researchers must address when
estimating antimicrobial exposure in Danish pig herds. Most challenges
presented are followed by at least one robust solution. A set of challenges
requiring awareness from the researcher, but for which no immediate solution
was available, were also presented. The selection of challenges and solutions
was based on a consensus by a cross-institutional group of researchers working
in projects using VetStat data. No quantitative data quality evaluations were
performed, as the frequency of errors and inconsistencies in a dataset will
vary, depending on the period covered in the data. Instead, this paper focuses
on clarifying how VetStat data may be translated to an estimation of the
antimicrobial exposure at herd level, by suggesting uniform methods of
extracting and editing data, in order to obtain reliable and comparable
estimates on pig antimicrobial consumption for research purposes.

  collocation Method with Genetic Strategy","  In this paper, we use Kansa method for solving the system of differential
equations in the area of biology. One of the challenges in Kansa method is
picking out an optimum value for Shape parameter in Radial Basis Function to
achieve the best result of the method because there are not any available
analytical approaches for obtaining optimum Shape parameter. For this reason,
we design a genetic algorithm to detect a close optimum Shape parameter. The
experimental results show that this strategy is efficient in the systems of
differential models in biology such as HIV and Influenza. Furthermore, we prove
that using Pseudo-Combination formula for crossover in genetic strategy leads
to convergence in the nearly best selection of Shape parameter.

1706.04610,2021-02-24,Transverse contributions to the longitudinal stiffness of the human foot,"  Humans rely on the foot's stiffness to withstand the propulsive forces of
walking and running. The medial longitudinal arch (MLA) and the transverse
tarsal arch (TTA) are key adaptations that increase the human midfoot's
longitudinal bending stiffness. The TTA is hypothesized to increase stiffness
through a cross-axis coupling between transverse tissue stiffness and
longitudinal midfoot stiffness. However, we currently lack in vivo tests of
this hypothesis. Such tests are crucial because muscle contraction considerably
modulates MLA function and may also affect the TTA's predicted cross-axis
coupling. Here we show in vivo evidence for substantial cross-axis coupling in
standing human subjects. We found that longitudinal midfoot bending stiffness
increased upon increasing transverse forefoot stiffness using an elastic tape
(mean$\pm$standard error = $76\% \pm 19\%$, p=0.0002), thus supporting the TTA
hypothesis. The cross-axis coupling could be a potential therapeutic target for
some foot disorders and help augment foot stiffness for athletics.

1706.05043,2018-02-07,"The thermodynamic efficiency of computations made in cells across the
  range of life","  Biological organisms must perform computation as they grow, reproduce, and
evolve. Moreover, ever since Landauer's bound was proposed it has been known
that all computation has some thermodynamic cost -- and that the same
computation can be achieved with greater or smaller thermodynamic cost
depending on how it is implemented. Accordingly an important issue concerning
the evolution of life is assessing the thermodynamic efficiency of the
computations performed by organisms. This issue is interesting both from the
perspective of how close life has come to maximally efficient computation
(presumably under the pressure of natural selection), and from the practical
perspective of what efficiencies we might hope that engineered biological
computers might achieve, especially in comparison with current computational
systems. Here we show that the computational efficiency of translation, defined
as free energy expended per amino acid operation, outperforms the best
supercomputers by several orders of magnitude, and is only about an order of
magnitude worse than the Landauer bound. However this efficiency depends
strongly on the size and architecture of the cell in question. In particular,
we show that the {\it useful} efficiency of an amino acid operation, defined as
the bulk energy per amino acid polymerization, decreases for increasing
bacterial size and converges to the polymerization cost of the ribosome. This
cost of the largest bacteria does not change in cells as we progress through
the major evolutionary shifts to both single and multicellular eukaryotes.
However, the rates of total computation per unit mass are nonmonotonic in
bacteria with increasing cell size, and also change across different biological
architectures including the shift from unicellular to multicellular eukaryotes.

1706.07091,2017-06-23,Time as it could Be measured in Artificial Living Systems,"  Being able to measure time, whether directly or indirectly, is a significant
advantage for an organism. It permits it to predict regular events, and prepare
for them on time. Thus, clocks are ubiquitous in biology. In the present paper,
we consider the most minimal abstract pure clocks and investigate their
characteristics with respect to their ability to measure time. Amongst other,
we find fundamentally diametral clock characteristics, such as oscillatory
behaviour for local time measurement or decay-based clocks measuring time
periods in scales global to the problem. We include also cascades of
independent clocks (""clock bags"") and composite clocks with controlled
dependency; the latter show various regimes of markedly different dynamics.

1706.08151,2017-06-27,The lunar cycle's influence on sex determination at conception in humans,"  The lunar cycle has long been suspected to influence biological phenomena.
Folklore alludes to such a relationship, but previous scientific analyses have
failed to find significant associations. It has been shown that lunar cycles
indeed have effects on animals; significant associations between human
circadian rhythms and lunar cycles have also been reported. We set out to
determine whether a significant statistical correlation exists between the
lunar phase and sex determination during conception. We found that significant
associations (\textit{p}-value $< 5 \times 10^{-5}$) exist between the average
sex ratio (male:female) and the lunar month. The likelihood of conception of a
male is at its highest point five days after the full moon, whereas the highest
likelihood of female conception occurs nineteen days after the full moon.
Furthermore, we found that the strength of this influence is correlated with
the amount of solar radiation (which is proportional to moonlight). Our results
suggest that sex determination may be influenced by the moon cycle, which
suggests the possibility of lunar influence on other biological phenomena. We
suggest for future research the exploration of similar effects in other
phenomena involving humans and other species.

both avian species and mammals. This article, however, conjectures that at the

variations among birds than among mammals. We explain this greater statistical

1707.03382,2017-07-12,SETI in vivo: testing the we-are-them hypothesis,"  After it was proposed that life on Earth might descend from seeding by an
earlier civilization, some authors noted that this alternative offers a
testable aspect: the seeds could be supplied with a signature that might be
found in extant organisms. In particular, it was suggested that the optimal
location for such an artifact is the genetic code, as the least evolving part
of cells. However, as the mainstream view goes, this scenario is too
speculative and cannot be meaningfully tested because encoding/decoding a
signature within the genetic code is ill-defined, so any retrieval attempt is
doomed to guesswork. Here we refresh the seeded-Earth hypothesis and discuss
the motivation for inserting a signature. We then show that ""biological SETI""
involves even weaker assumptions than traditional SETI and admits a
well-defined methodological framework. After assessing the possibility in terms
of molecular and evolutionary biology, we formalize the approach and, adopting
the guideline of SETI that encoding/decoding should follow from first
principles and be convention-free, develop a retrieval strategy. Applied to the
canonical code, it reveals a nontrivial precision structure of interlocked
systematic attributes. To assess this result in view of the initial assumption,
we perform statistical, comparison, interdependence, and semiotic analyses.
Statistical analysis reveals no causal connection to evolutionary models of the
code, interdependence analysis precludes overinterpretation, and comparison
analysis shows that known code variations lack any precision-logic structures,
in agreement with these variations being post-seeding deviations from the
canonical code. Finally, semiotic analysis shows that not only the found
attributes are consistent with the initial assumption, but that they make
perfect sense from SETI perspective, as they maintain some of the most
universal codes of culture.

  Alginate-Ca Microcapsules using Microfluidic Devices","  The indiscriminate use of antibiotics and the emergence of resistant
microorganisms have become a major challenge for the food industry. The purpose
of this work was to microencapsulate the bacteriophage UFV-AREG1 in a calcium
alginate matrix using microfluidic devices and to study the viability and
efficiency of retention. The microcapsules were added to gel of propylene
glycol for use as an antimicrobial in the food industry. The technique showed
the number of the phage encapsulation, yielding drops with an average 100-250
$\mu$m of diameter, 82.1 $\pm$ 2% retention efficiency and stability in the gel
matrix for 21 days. The gel added to the microencapsulated phage showed
efficiency (not detectable on the surface) in reducing bacterial contamination
on the surface at a similar level to antimicrobial chemicals (alcohol 70%).
Therefore, it was possible to microencapsulate bacteriophages in alginate-Ca
and apply the microcapsules in gels for use as sanitizers in the food industry.

1707.05636,2017-07-19,Self-Organization and Fractality in the Metabolic Process of Glycolysis,"  Within a mathematical model, the metabolic process of glycolysis is studied.
The general scheme of glycolysis is considered as a natural result of the
biochemical evolution. By using the theory of dissipative structures, the
conditions of self-organization of the given process are sought. The
autocatalytic processes resulting in the conservation of cyclicity in the
dynamics of the process are determined. The conditions of breaking of the
synchronization of the process, increase in the multiplicity of a cyclicity,
and appearance of chaotic modes are studied. The phase-parametric diagrams of a
cascade of bifurcations, which characterize the transition to chaotic modes
according to the Feigenbaum scenario and the intermittence, are constructed.
The strange attractors formed as a result of the funnel effect are found. The
complete spectra of Lyapunov indices and divergences for the obtained modes are
calculated. The values of KS-entropy, horizons of predictability, and Lyapunov
dimensions of strange attractors are determined. Some conclusions concerning
the structural-functional connections in glycolysis and their influence on the
stability of the metabolic process in a cell are presented.

  Bio-informatics Data","  Large volume of Genomics data is produced on daily basis due to the
advancement in sequencing technology. This data is of no value if it is not
properly analysed. Different kinds of analytics are required to extract useful
information from this raw data. Classification, Prediction, Clustering and
Pattern Extraction are useful techniques of data mining. These techniques
require appropriate selection of attributes of data for getting accurate
results. However, Bioinformatics data is high dimensional, usually having
hundreds of attributes. Such large a number of attributes affect the
performance of machine learning algorithms used for classification/prediction.
So, dimensionality reduction techniques are required to reduce the number of

Component Analysis and Factor Analysis are used for dimensionality reduction of
Bioinformatics data. These techniques were applied on Leukaemia data set and
the number of attributes was reduced from to.

1707.08242,2017-08-08,"Promoting lentil germination and stem growth by plasma activated tap
  water, demineralized water and liquid fertilizer","  Tap water, demineralized water and liquid fertilizer have been activated
using an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) to investigate their benefits
for the germination rate and stem elongation rate of lentils from Puy-en-Velay
(France). By plasma-activating tap water, we have obtained germination rates as
high as 80% (instead of 30% with tap water). Also, higher stem elongation rates
and final stem lengths were obtained using activated tap water compared with
commercial fertilizer. We show that these rates of germination and stem growth
strongly depend on the combination of two radicals generated in the liquids by
the plasma: hydrogen peroxide and nitrate. This synergy appears to be a
condition for releasing seed dormancy through the endogenous production of NO
radicals.

1708.01337,2018-03-06,"Interactions of Fungi with Concrete: Significant Importance for
  Bio-Based Self-Healing Concrete","  The goal of this study is to explore a new self-healing concept in which
fungi are used as a self-healing agent to promote calcium mineral precipitation
to fill the cracks in concrete. An initial screening of different species of
fungi has been conducted. Fungal growth medium was overlaid onto cured concrete
plate. Mycelial discs were aseptically deposited at the plate center. The
results showed that, due to the dissolving of Ca(OH)2 from concrete, the pH of
the growth medium increased from its original value of 6.5 to 13.0. Despite the
drastic pH increase, Trichoderma reesei (ATCC13631) spores germinated into
hyphal mycelium and grew equally well with or without concrete. X-ray
diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) confirmed that the
crystals precipitated on the fungal hyphae were composed of calcite. These
results indicate that T. reesei has great potential to be used in bio-based
self-healing concrete for sustainable infrastructure.

1708.02694,2017-08-15,"Human Skin Detection Using RGB, HSV and YCbCr Color Models","  Human Skin detection deals with the recognition of skin-colored pixels and
regions in a given image. Skin color is often used in human skin detection
because it is invariant to orientation and size and is fast to process. A new
human skin detection algorithm is proposed in this paper. The three main
parameters for recognizing a skin pixel are RGB (Red, Green, Blue), HSV (Hue,
Saturation, Value) and YCbCr (Luminance, Chrominance) color models. The
objective of proposed algorithm is to improve the recognition of skin pixels in
given images. The algorithm not only considers individual ranges of the three
color parameters but also takes into ac- count combinational ranges which
provide greater accuracy in recognizing the skin area in a given image.

1709.00284,2018-02-26,Towards physical principles of biological evolution,"  Biological systems reach organizational complexity that far exceeds the
complexity of any known inanimate objects. Biological entities undoubtedly obey
the laws of quantum physics and statistical mechanics. However, is modern
physics sufficient to adequately describe, model and explain the evolution of
biological complexity? Detailed parallels have been drawn between statistical
thermodynamics and the population-genetic theory of biological evolution. Based
on these parallels, we outline new perspectives on biological innovation and
major transitions in evolution, and introduce a biological equivalent of
thermodynamic potential that reflects the innovation propensity of an evolving
population. Deep analogies have been suggested to also exist between the
properties of biological entities and processes, and those of frustrated states
in physics, such as glasses. We extend such analogies by examining
frustration-type phenomena, such as conflicts between different levels of
selection, in biological evolution. We further address evolution in
multidimensional fitness landscapes from the point of view of percolation
theory and suggest that percolation at level above the critical threshold
dictates the tree-like evolution of complex organisms. Taken together, these
multiple connections between fundamental processes in physics and biology imply
that construction of a meaningful physical theory of biological evolution might
not be a futile effort.
"
1709.01712,2017-09-13,Information Theory and the Length Distribution of all Discrete Systems,"  We begin with the extraordinary observation that the length distribution of
80 million proteins in UniProt, the Universal Protein Resource, measured in
amino acids, is qualitatively identical to the length distribution of large
collections of computer functions measured in programming language tokens, at
all scales. That two such disparate discrete systems share important structural
properties suggests that yet other apparently unrelated discrete systems might
share the same properties, and certainly invites an explanation.
  We demonstrate that this is inevitable for all discrete systems of components
built from tokens or symbols. Departing from existing work by embedding the
Conservation of Hartley-Shannon information (CoHSI) in a classical statistical
mechanics framework, we identify two kinds of discrete system, heterogeneous
and homogeneous. Heterogeneous systems contain components built from a unique
alphabet of tokens and yield an implicit CoHSI distribution with a sharp
unimodal peak asymptoting to a power-law. Homogeneous systems contain
components each built from just one kind of token unique to that component and
yield a CoHSI distribution corresponding to Zipf's law.
  This theory is applied to heterogeneous systems, (proteome, computer
software, music); homogeneous systems (language texts, abundance of the
elements); and to systems in which both heterogeneous and homogeneous behaviour
co-exist (word frequencies and word length frequencies in language texts). In
each case, the predictions of the theory are tested and supported to high
levels of statistical significance. We also show that in the same heterogeneous
system, different but consistent alphabets must be related by a power-law. We
demonstrate this on a large body of music by excluding and including note
duration in the definition of the unique alphabet of notes.

1709.04943,2020-05-26,The rules of long DNA-sequences and tetra-groups of oligonucleotides,"  The article represents a new class of hidden symmetries in long sequences of
oligonucleotides of single stranded DNA from their representative set. These
symmetries are an addition to symmetries described by the second parity rule of
Chargaff. These new symmetries and their rules concern collective probabilities
of oligonucleotides from special tetra-groups and their subgroups in long
DNA-texts including complete sets of chromosomes of human and some model
organisms. These rules of tetra-group probabilities are considered as possible
candidacies for the role of universal rules of long DNA-sequences. A
quantum-informational model of genetic symmetries of these collective
probabilities is proposed on the basis of the known quantum-mechanic statement
that quantum state of a multicomponent system is defined by the tensor product
of quantum states of its subsystems. In this model, nitrogenous bases C, T, G,
A of DNA are represented as computational basis states of 2-qubit quantum
CTGA-systems. The biological meaning of these new quantum-information
symmetries of long DNA texts is associated with the common ability of all
living organisms to grow and develop on the basis of incorporation into their
body of new and new molecules of nutrients becoming new quantum-mechanic
subsystems of the united quantum-mechanic organism. An important role of
resonances, photons and photonic crystals in quantum information genetics is
noted.

1709.05429,2018-04-06,"An Algorithmic Information Calculus for Causal Discovery and
  Reprogramming Systems","  We demonstrate that the algorithmic information content of a system is deeply
connected to its potential dynamics, thus affording an avenue for moving
systems in the information-theoretic space and controlling them in the phase
space. To this end we performed experiments and validated the results on (1) a
very large set of small graphs, (2) a number of larger networks with different
topologies, and (3) biological networks from a widely studied and validated
genetic network (e.coli) as well as on a significant number of differentiating
(Th17) and differentiated human cells from high quality databases (Harvard's
CellNet) with results conforming to experimentally validated biological data.
Based on these results we introduce a conceptual framework, a model-based
interventional calculus and a reprogrammability measure with which to steer,
manipulate, and reconstruct the dynamics of non- linear dynamical systems from
partial and disordered observations. The method consists in finding and
applying a series of controlled interventions to a dynamical system to estimate
how its algorithmic information content is affected when every one of its
elements are perturbed. The approach represents an alternative to numerical
simulation and statistical approaches for inferring causal
mechanistic/generative models and finding first principles. We demonstrate the
framework's capabilities by reconstructing the phase space of some discrete
dynamical systems (cellular automata) as case study and reconstructing their
generating rules. We thus advance tools for reprogramming artificial and living
systems without full knowledge or access to the system's actual kinetic
equations or probability distributions yielding a suite of universal and
parameter-free algorithms of wide applicability ranging from causation,
dimension reduction, feature selection and model generation.

1709.05971,2017-09-19,"Quantum origin of life: methodological, epistemological and ontological
  issues","  The aim of this essay is to analyze the role of quantum mechanics as an
inherent characteristic of life. During the last ten years the problem of the
origin of life has become an innovative research subject approached by many
authors. The essay is divided in to three parts: the first deals with the
problem of life from a philosophical and biological perspective. The second
presents the conceptual and methodological basis of the essay which is founded
on the Information Theory and the Quantum Theory. This basis is then used, in
the third part, to discuss the different arguments and conjectures of a quantum
origin of life. There are many philosophical views on the problem of life, two
of which are especially important at the moment: reductive physicalism and
biosystemic emergentism. From a scientific perspective, all the theories and
experimental evidences put forward by Biology can be summed up in to two main
research themes: the RNA world and the vesicular theory. The RNA world, from a
physicalist point of view, maintains that replication is the essence of life
while the vesicular theory, founded on biosystemic grounds, believes the
essence of life can be found in cellular metabolism. This essay uses the
Information Theory to discard the idea of a spontaneous emergency of life
through replication. Understanding the nature and basis of quantum mechanics is
fundamental in order to be able to comprehend the advantages of using quantum
computation to be able increase the probabilities of existence of auto
replicative structures. Different arguments are set forth such as the inherence
of quantum mechanics to the origin of life. Finally, in order to try to resolve
the question of auto replication, three scientific propositions are put
forward: Q-life, the quantum combinatory library and the role of algorithms in
the origin of genetic language.

  integration of scientific disciplines","  Astrobiology is a scientific discipline that studies life in the Universe. We
call it a discipline and not a science because some authors have cast doubts
over its epistemological status by calling it 'a science without an object of
study'. As with astrophysics, the scientific nature of astrobiology is related
to historical-narrative sciences and nomothetic sciences. This discipline also
integrates complex methodological and conceptual problems which originate from
the methodological and epistemological differences that exist between physics
and biology. This is why it is so important to evidence the different
philosophical approaches from which its results are interpreted. After a brief
historical introduction, we will consider the problem of life and we will
analyse the influence that different philosophical approaches have on
astrobiology. Subsequently, we will introduce ontological and epistemological
questions that originate from interdisciplinarity, for example, their role in a
physicalistic type of reductionism and in teleology.

  Medicine","  The goal of this paper is to advance an extensible theory of living systems
using an approach to biomathematics and biocomputation that suitably addresses
self-organized, self-referential and anticipatory systems with multi-temporal
multi-agents. Our first step is to provide foundations for modelling of
emergent and evolving dynamic multi-level organic complexes and their
sustentative processes in artificial and natural life systems. Main
applications are in life sciences, medicine, ecology and astrobiology, as well
as robotics, industrial automation and man-machine interface. Since 2011 over
100 scientists from a number of disciplines have been exploring a substantial
set of theoretical frameworks for a comprehensive theory of life known as
Integral Biomathics. That effort identified the need for a robust core model of
organisms as dynamic wholes, using advanced and adequately computable
mathematics. The work described here for that core combines the advantages of a
situation and context aware multivalent computational logic for active
self-organizing networks, Wandering Logic Intelligence (WLI), and a multi-scale
dynamic category theory, Memory Evolutive Systems (MES), hence WLIMES. This is
presented to the modeller via a formal augmented reality language as a first
step towards practical modelling and simulation of multi-level living systems.
Initial work focuses on the design and implementation of this visual language
and calculus (VLC) and its graphical user interface. The results will be
integrated within the current methodology and practices of theoretical biology
and (personalized) medicine to deepen and to enhance the holistic understanding

  of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy Patients","  There are many functions which are continuous everywhere but
non-differentiable at some or all points such functions are termed as
unreachable functions. Graphs representing such unreachable functions are
called unreachable graphs. For example, ECG is such an unreachable graph.
Classical calculus fails in their characterization as derivatives do not exist
at the unreachable points. Such unreachable functions can be characterized by
fractional calculus as fractional derivatives exist at those unreachable points
where classical derivatives do not exist. Definition of fractional derivatives
has been proposed by several mathematicians like Grunwald-Letinikov,
Riemann-Liouville, Caputo, and Jumarie to develop the theory of fractional
calculus. In this paper, we have used Jumarie type fractional derivative and
consequently the phase transition (P.T.) which is the difference between left
fractional derivative and right fractional derivatives to characterize those
points. A comparative study has been done between normal ECG sample and
problematic ECG sample (Right Ventricular Hypertrophy) by the help of the above
mentioned mathematical tool.

1711.03575,2025-05-26,"Outward Sodium Current, Fine-structure Constant and Ferroelectric
  Hysteresis Regimes in the Giant Squid Axon Propagating Action Potential: a
  Phase Space Approach","  We derive a charge-conserving phase space cable equation for the propagating
action potential, expressing ionic, membrane, and capacitive currents as
functions of membrane potential. Analysis of the ionic current during the
recovery phase reveals an outward sodium current, unobserved in voltage-clamp
experiments, arising from the axoplasmic modulated Ohmic current creating a
positive charge gradient opposing the sodium concentration gradient. Using a
single assumption, that the fraction of open channels follows a time-dependent
modified Avrami (mAvrami) equation that incorporates the ionic time rate
yielding the fine-structure constant as a dimensionless scaling factor, we fit
experimental ionic currents across different ions and biological temperatures.
These results accurately predict several established observations, including
the delayed onset of sodium inactivation, the magnitude of gating charges, and
the fact that the fraction of open sodium channels is about 1/5 when most of
the gating charges have moved. These alignments with already established facts
logically increase confidence that the remaining predictions/hypotheses will be
confirmed by future experiments. Notably, the mAvrami kinetics predictions
include a universal role for the fine-structure constant in ion traversing
ionic channels, and temperature-independent ionic activation energies are
suggestive of quantum tunneling. Further predictions reveal continuous phase
transitions in sodium channels at both initiation and peak of the action
potential, implying symmetry changes in sodium channel states and pointing to a
potential mechanism for memory encoding and storage. Also, the calculated
optimal sodium channel density closely matches observed values. We also show
that the action potential follows a heat-releasing ferroelectric hysteresis
loop.

1711.09692,2017-11-28,"On the Mathematics of Fraternal Birth Order Effect and the Genetics of
  Homosexuality","  Mathematicians have always been attracted to the field of genetics. I am
especially interested in the mathematical aspects of research on homosexuality.
Certain studies show that male homosexuality may have a genetic component that
is correlated with female fertility. Other studies show the existence of the
fraternal birth order effect, that is the correlation of homosexuality with the
number of older brothers.
  This paper is devoted to the mathematical aspects of how these two phenomena
are interconnected. In particular, I show that the fraternal birth order effect
produces a correlation between homosexuality and maternal fecundity. Vice
versa, I show that the correlation between homosexuality and female fecundity
implies the increase of the probability of the younger brothers being
homosexual.

1711.10009,2017-11-29,The evolution and structure of biomedical knowledge on cytochrome P450,"  Cytochrome P450 are fundamental proteins to the metabolism of drugs and other
relevant processes. through a combination of text mining and network analysis
of the P450 literature we mapped the emergence and evolution of the biomedical
research communities working on this family of proteins. Our results suggest
that the historical research communities that worked on P450 emerged and were
organized mainly around methodological achievements like the induction of
animal liver microsomal P450 by drugs, the use of chemical inhibitors of P450
enzymes in in-vitro metabolism studies and the development of E. coli
expression systems. We found clear evidence that P450 research indeed
constitutes a material scientific culture, as we discuss in the text.

1711.10386,2018-07-17,Screening of Fungi for the Application of Self-Healing Concrete,"  Concrete is susceptible to cracking owing to drying shrinkage, freeze-thaw
cycles, delayed ettringite formation, reinforcement corrosion, creep and
fatigue, etc. Since maintenance and inspection of concrete infrastructure
require onerous labor and high costs, self-healing of harmful cracks without
human interference or intervention could be of great attraction. The goal of
this study is to explore a new self-healing approach in which fungi are used as
a self-healing agent to promote calcium carbonate precipitation to fill the
cracks in concrete structures. Recent research results in the field of
geomycology have shown that many species of fungi could play an important role
in promoting calcium carbonate mineralization, but their application in
self-healing concrete has not been reported. Therefore, a screening of
different species of fungi has been conducted in this study. Our results showed
that, despite the drastic pH increase owing to the leaching of calcium
hydroxide from concrete, Aspergillus nidulans (MAD1445), a pH regulatory
mutant, could grow on concrete plates and promote calcium carbonate
precipitation.

1711.11004,2017-11-30,"Sequencing single-stranded libraries on the Illumina NextSeq 500
  platform","  Single-stranded libraries generated from ancient DNA extracts have specific
sequencing requirements. The short library molecules typically associated with
ancient DNA templates are expected to behave differently during the annealing
to the flow cell and subsequent cluster generation (bridge PCR), requiring
optimisation of loading amounts to obtain optimal and consistent cluster
densities. For the past 3 years, we have carried out sequencing of
single-stranded libraries on the Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencing platform at
the Institute for Biochemistry and Biology, University of Potsdam. We report
our optimisations here. This document may be useful for other researchers
wishing to sequence single-stranded libraries on the NextSeq 500 platform. It
does not replace the excellent documentation provided by Illumina (links
provided below), but rather serves as additional information specific to
single-stranded libraries. The original papers describing the library protocol
should also be studied in detail, and complement the information presented
here.

1712.01662,2018-08-03,"Optimizing colormaps with consideration for color vision deficiency to
  enable accurate interpretation of scientific data","  Color vision deficiency (CVD) affects more than 4% of the population and
leads to a different visual perception of colors. Though this has been known
for decades, colormaps with many colors across the visual spectra are often
used to represent data, leading to the potential for misinterpretation or
difficulty with interpretation by someone with this deficiency. Until the
creation of the module presented here, there were no colormaps mathematically
optimized for CVD using modern color appearance models. While there have been
some attempts to make aesthetically pleasing or subjectively tolerable
colormaps for those with CVD, our goal was to make optimized colormaps for the
most accurate perception of scientific data by as many viewers as possible. We
developed a Python module, cmaputil, to create CVD-optimized colormaps, which
imports colormaps and modifies them to be perceptually uniform in CVD-safe
colorspace while linearizing and maximizing the brightness range. The module is
made available to the science community to enable others to easily create their
own CVDoptimized colormaps. Here, we present an example CVD-optimized colormap
created with this module that is optimized for viewing by those without a CVD
as well as those with redgreen colorblindness. This colormap, cividis, enables
nearly-identical visual-data interpretation to both groups, is perceptually
uniform in hue and brightness, and increases in brightness linearly.

1712.04546,2017-12-20,Encoding DNA sequences by integer chaos game representation,"  DNA sequences are fundamental for encoding genetic information. The genetic
information may not only be understood by symbolic sequences but also from the
hidden signals inside the sequences. The symbolic sequences need to be
transformed into numerical sequences so the hidden signals can be revealed by
signal processing techniques. All current transformation methods encode DNA
sequences into numerical values of the same length. These representations have
limitations in the applications of genomic signal compression, encryption, and
steganography. We propose an integer chaos game representation (iCGR) of DNA
sequences and a lossless encoding method DNA sequences by the iCGR. In the iCGR
method, a DNA sequence is represented by the iterated function of the
nucleotides and their positions in the sequence. Then the DNA sequence can be
uniquely encoded and recovered using three integers from iCGR. One integer is
the sequence length and the other two integers represent the accumulated
distributions of nucleotides in the sequence. The integer encoding scheme can
compress a DNA sequence by 2 bits per nucleotide. The integer representation of
DNA sequences provides a prospective tool for sequence compression, encryption,
and steganography. The Python programs in this study are freely available to
the public at https://github.com/cyinbox/iCGR

1712.05774,2018-12-27,"Traveling pulse emerges from individuals coordinating their stop-and-go
  motion: a case study in sheep","  Monitoring small groups of sheep in spontaneous evolution in the field, we
decipher behavioural rules that sheep follow at the individual scale in order
to sustain collective motion. Individuals alternate grazing mode at null speed
and moving mode at walking speed, so cohesive motion stems from synchronising
when they decide to switch between the two modes. We propose a model for the
individual decision making process, based on switching rates between stopped /
walking states that depend on behind / ahead locations and states of the
others. We parametrize this model from data. Next, we translate this
(microscopic) individual-based model into its density-flow (macroscopic)
equations counterpart. Numerical solving these equations display a traveling
pulse propagating at constant speed even though each individual is at any
moment either stopped or walking. Considering the minimal model embedded in
these equations, we derive analytically the steady shape of the pulse (sech
square). The parameters of the pulse (shape and speed) are expressed as
functions of individual parameters. This pulse emerges from the non linear
coupling of start/stop individual decisions which compensate exactly for
diffusion and promotes a steady ratio of walking / stopped individuals, which
in turn determines the traveling speed of the pulse. The system seems to
converge to this pulse from any initial condition, and to recover the pulse
after perturbation. This gives a high robustness to this coordination
mechanism.

1712.08369,2018-02-23,Nobel Symposium 162 - Microfluidics,"  The Nobel Foundation's Symposium programme was initiated in 1965 and since
then over 160 symposia have taken place. With the Nobel symposium summarized in
this proceedings volume, we had the ambition to cover the past, current and
future developments of microfluidics; a highly challenging task as there are
many excellent researchers in this area and only thirty slots in the program.
We tried to cover the early breakthrough contributions to the field, important
developments over the years and applications of microfluidics that now
propagate in vastly different directions both as industrial components or
processes and as tools and methods supporting fundamental research. To give the
entire research community an opportunity to sample the science presented at the
symposium we have compiled a symposium volume that reflects the major messages
conveyed by our invited speakers. We are deeply grateful to the effort that our
participants put into writing their lecture notes/abstracts.

1712.09100,2020-04-16,"Porous translucent electrodes enhance current generation from
  photosynthetic biofilms","  We tested the enhancement of electrical current generated from
photosynthetically active bacteria by use of electrodes with porosity on the
nano- and micrometer length-scale. For two cyanobacteria on structured
indium-tin-oxide electrodes, current generation was increased by two orders of
magnitude and the photo-response was substantially faster compared to
non-porous anodes. These properties highlight porosity as an important design
strategy for electrochemical bio-interfaces. The role of porosity on different
length scales was studied systematically which revealed that the main
performance enhancement was caused by the increased surface area of the
electrodes. More complex microstructured architectures which spanned biofilms
as translucent 3D scaffolds provided additional advantage in the presence of
microbial direct electron transfer (DET). The absence of a clear DET
contribution in both studied cyanobacteria, Synechocystis and Nostoc, raises
questions about the role of conductive cellular components previously found in
both organisms.

1801.02435,2019-01-11,"Mean squared displacement and sinuosity of three-dimensional random
  search movements","  Correlated random walks (CRW) have been used for a long time as a null model
for animal's random search movement in two dimensions (2D). An increasing
number of studies focus on animals' movement in three dimensions (3D), but the
key properties of CRW, such as the way the mean squared displacement is related
to the path length, are well known only in 1D and 2D. In this paper I derive
such properties for 3D CRW, in a consistent way with the expression of these
properties in 2D. This should allow 3D CRW to act as a null model when
analyzing actual 3D movements similarly to what is done in 2D
"
1801.05452,2021-09-24,"Asking Biological Questions of Physical Systems: the Device Approach to
  Emergent Properties","  Life occurs in concentrated `Ringer Solutions' derived from seawater that
Lesser Blum studied for most of his life. As we worked together, Lesser and I
realized that the questions asked of those solutions were quite different in
biology from those in the physical chemistry he knew. Biology is inherited.
Information is passed by handfuls of atoms in the genetic code. A few atoms in
the proteins built from the code change macroscopic function. Indeed, a few
atoms often control biological function in the same sense that a gas pedal
controls the speed of a car. Biological questions then are most productive when
they are asked in the context of evolution. What function does a system
perform? How is the system built to perform that function? What forces are used
to perform that function? How are the modules that perform functions connected
to make the machinery of life. Physiologists have shown that much of life is a
nested hierarchy of devices, one on top of another, linking atomic ions in
concentrated solutions to current flow through proteins, current flow to
voltage signals, voltage signals to changes in current flow, all connected to
make a regenerative system that allows electrical action potentials to move
meters, under the control of a few atoms. The hierarchy of devices allows
macroscopic properties to emerge from atomic scale interactions. The structures
of biology create these devices. The concentration and electrical fields of
biology power these devices, more than anything else. The resulting organisms
reproduce. Evolution selects the organisms that reproduce more and thereby
selects the devices that allow macroscopic control to emerge from the atomic
structures of genes and proteins and their motions.
"
1801.08073,2018-01-25,Thermodynamic Mechanism of Life and Aging,"  Life is a complex biological phenomenon represented by numerous chemical,
physical and biological processes performed by a biothermodynamic
system/cell/organism. Both living organisms and inanimate objects are subject
to aging, a biological and physicochemical process characterized by changes in
biological and thermodynamic state. Thus, the same physical laws govern
processes in both animate and inanimate matter. All life processes lead to
change of an organism's state. The change of biological and thermodynamic state
of an organism in time underlies all of three kinds of aging (chronological,
biological and thermodynamic). Life and aging of an organism both start at the
moment of fertilization and continue through entire lifespan. Fertilization
represents formation of a new organism. The new organism represents a new
thermodynamic system. From the very beginning, it changes its state by changing
thermodynamic parameters. The change of thermodynamic parameters is observed as
aging and can be related to change in entropy. Entropy is thus the parameter
that is related to all others and describes aging in the best manner. In the
beginning, entropy change appears as a consequence of accumulation of matter
(growth). Later, decomposition and configurational changes dominate, as a
consequence of various chemical reactions (free radical, decomposition,
fragmentation, accumulation of lipofuscin-like substances...).

1801.08137,2018-01-26,Nerve impulse propagation and wavelet theory,"  A luminous stimulus which penetrates in a retina is converted to a nerve
message. Ganglion cells give a response that may be approximated by a wavelet.
We determine a function PSI which is associated with the propagation of nerve
impulses along an axon. Each kind of channel (inward and outward) may be open
or closed, depending on the transmembrane potential. The transition between
these states is a random event. Using quantum relations, we estimate the number
of channels susceptible to switch between the closed and open states. Our
quantum approach was first to calculate the energy level distribution in a
channel. We obtain, for each kind of channel, the empty level density and the
filled level density of the open and closed conformations. The joint density of
levels provides the transition number between the closed and open
conformations. The algebraic sum of inward and outward open channels is a
function PSI of the normalized energy E. The function PSI verifies the major
properties of a wavelet. We calculate the functional dependence of the axon
membrane conductance with the transmembrane energy.

1802.00858,2018-02-06,"Hierarchical evolutive systems, fuzzy categories and the living single
  cell","  In this article, the theory of hierarchical evolutive systems of Ehresmann
and Vandremeersch [Bull. Math. Bio. 49, 13-50 (1987)] is improved by
considering the categories of the theory as fuzzy sets whose elements are the
composite objects formed by the arrows and corresponding vertices of their
embedded graphs. This way each category can be represented as a point in the
states space [0.1]**N. The introduction of a diffeomorphism, that acts in this
context as a functor between categories, allows to define a measure preserving
dynamical system. In particular, we apply this formalism to describe a living
single cell. We propose for its state at a given time a hirerchical category
with three levels (molecular, coarse-grained and cellular levels) related by
adequate colimits. Each level involves the main functional and structural
modules in which the cell can be partitioned. The time evolution of the cell is
drived by a transformation which is a N-dimensional generalization of the
Ricker map whose parameters we propose to be determined by requiring that, as
hallmark of its behavior, the living cell to evolve at the edge of chaos. From
the dynamical point of view this property manifests in the fact that the
largest Lyapunov exponent is equal to zero. Since in a rather complete model of
the living cell the huge number of involved parameters can make of the
calculations a hard task, we also propose a toy model, with fewer parameters to
be determined, which emphasizes the cellular fission.
"
1802.02223,2018-09-19,Seeded Ising Model and Statistical Natures of Human Iris Templates,"  We propose a variant of Ising model, called the Seeded Ising Model, to model
probabilistic nature of human iris templates. This model is an Ising model in
which the values at certain lattice points are held fixed throughout Ising
model evolution. Using this we show how to reconstruct the full iris template
from partial information, and we show that about 1/6 of the given template is
needed to recover almost all information content of the original one in the
sense that the resulting Hamming distance is well within the range to assert
correctly the identity of the subject. This leads us to propose the concept of
effective statistical degree of freedom of iris templates and show it is about
1/6 of the total number of bits. In particular, for a template of $2048$ bits,
its effective statistical degree of freedom is about $342$ bits, which
coincides very well with the degree of freedom computed by the completely
different method proposed by Daugman.

1802.02546,2018-03-15,"A mathematical model of the metabolism of a cell. Self-organization and
  chaos","  Using the classical tools of nonlinear dynamics, we study the process of
self-organization and the appearance of the chaos in the metabolic process in a
cell with the help of a mathematical model of the transformation of steroids by
a cell Arthrobacter globiformis. We constructed the phase-parametric diagrams
obtained under a variation of the dissipation of the kinetic membrane
potential. The oscillatory modes obtained are classified as regular and strange
attractors. We calculated the bifurcations, by which the self-organization and
the chaos occur in the system, and the transitions ""chaos-order"",
""order-chaos"", ""order-order"", and ""chaos-chaos"" arise. Feigenbaum's scenarios
and the intermittences are found. For some selected modes, the projections of
the phase portraits of attractors, Poincar\'e sections, and Poincar\'e maps are
constructed. The total spectra of Lyapunov indices for the modes under study
are calculated. The structural stability of the attractors is demonstrated. A
general scenario of the formation of regular and strange attractors in the
given metabolic process in a cell is found. The physical nature of their
appearance in the metabolic process is studied.

1802.02610,2018-02-09,"Telling apart <I>Felidae</I> and <I>Ursidae</I> from the distribution of
  nucleotides in mitochondrial DNA","  Rank--frequency distributions of nucleotide sequences in mitochondrial DNA
are defined in a way analogous to the linguistic approach, with the
highest-frequent nucleobase serving as a whitespace. For such sequences,
entropy and mean length are calculated. These parameters are shown to
discriminate the species of the <I>Felidae</I> (cats) and <I>Ursidae</I>
(bears) families. From purely numerical values we are able to see in particular
that giant pandas are bears while koalas are not. The observed linear relation
between the parameters is explained using a simple probabilistic model. The
approach based on the nonadditive generalization of the Bose-distribution is
used to analyze the frequency spectra of the nucleotide sequences. In this
case, the separation of families is not very sharp. Nevertheless, the
distributions for <I>Felidae</I> have on average longer tails comparing to
<I>Ursidae</I>.

1802.06326,2018-02-20,"Sensitivity and Bifurcation Analysis of a DAE Model for a Microbial
  Electrolysis Cell","  Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) are a promising new technology for
producing hydrogen cheaply, efficiently, and sustainably. However, to scale up
this technology, we need a better understanding of the processes in the
devices. In this effort, we present a differential-algebraic equation (DAE)
model of a microbial electrolysis cell with an algebraic constraint on current.
We then perform sensitivity and bifurcation analysis for the DAE system. The
model can be applied either to batch-cycle MECs or to continuous-flow MECs. We
conduct differential-algebraic sensitivity analysis after fitting simulations
to current density data for a batch-cycle MEC. The sensitivity analysis
suggests which parameters have the greatest influence on the current density at
particular times during the experiment. In particular, growth and consumption
parameters for exoelectrogenic bacteria have a strong effect prior to the peak
current density. An alternative strategy to maximizing peak current density is
maintaining a long term stable equilibrium with non-zero current density in a
continuous-flow MEC. We characterize the minimum dilution rate required for a
stable nonzero current equilibrium and demonstrate transcritical bifurcations
in the dilution rate parameter that exchange stability between several curves
of equilibria. Specifically, increasing the dilution rate transitions the
system through three regimes where the stable equilibrium exhibits (i)
competitive exclusion by methanogens, (ii) coexistence, and (iii) competitive
exclusion by exolectrogens. Positive long term current production is only
feasible in the final two regimes. These results suggest how to modify system
parameters to increase peak current density in a batch-cycle MEC or to increase
the long term current density equilibrium value in a continuous-flow MEC.

strides in those steps. This manuscript is a technical report summarizing these
achievements, and we hope serves as an example of the effectiveness of focused,
deliberate hackathons towards the advancement of our quickly-evolving field.

  tissue source in larch total transcriptome","  We studied the structuredness ensemble of transcriptome of Siberian larch.
The clusters in 64-dimensional space were identified with $K$-means technique,
where the objects to be clusterized are the different fragments of the genome.
A tetrahedron like structure in distribution of these fragments was found.
Chargaff's discrepancy measure was determined for each class, as well as that
latter between the classes. It reveals a relative similitude of the classes.
The results have been compared to those obtained for specific transcriptome of
each tissue. Also, a surrogate transcriptome has been developed comprising the
contigs assembled for specific tissues; that latter has been compared with the
real total transcriptome, and significant difference has been observed.

  based on large-scale nutrient composition data","  Diet design for vegetarian health is challenging due to the limited food
repertoire of vegetarians. This challenge can be partially overcome by
quantitative, data-driven approaches that utilise massive nutritional
information collected for many different foods. Based on large-scale data of
foods' nutrient compositions, the recent concept of nutritional fitness helps
quantify a nutrient balance within each food with regard to satisfying daily
nutritional requirements. Nutritional fitness offers prioritisation of
recommended foods using the foods' occurrence in nutritionally adequate food
combinations. Here, we systematically identify nutritionally recommendable
foods for semi- to strict vegetarian diets through the computation of
nutritional fitness. Along with commonly recommendable foods across different
diets, our analysis reveals favourable foods specific to each diet, such as
immature lima beans for a vegan diet as an amino acid and choline source, and
mushrooms for ovo-lacto vegetarian and vegan diets as a vitamin D source.
Furthermore, we find that selenium and other essential micronutrients can be
subject to deficiency in plant-based diets, and suggest nutritionally-desirable
dietary patterns. We extend our analysis to two hypothetical scenarios of
highly personalised, plant-based methionine-restricted diets. Our
nutrient-profiling approach may provide a useful guide for designing different
types of personalised vegetarian diets.

most fundamental concepts used by scientists to understand both static and

1804.02436,2018-04-10,"Water Bridging Dynamics of Polymerase Chain Reaction in the Gauge Theory
  Paradigm of Quantum Fields","  We discuss the role of water bridging the DNA-enzyme interaction by resorting
to recent results showing that London dispersion forces between delocalized
electrons of base pairs of DNA are responsible for the formation of dipole
modes that can be recognized by \textit{Taq} polymerase. We describe the
dynamic origin of the high efficiency and precise targeting of \textit{Taq}
activity in PCR. The spatiotemporal distribution of interaction couplings,
frequencies, amplitudes, and phase modulations comprise a pattern of fields
which constitutes the electromagnetic image of DNA in the surrounding water,
which is what the polymerase enzyme actually recognizes in the DNA water
environment. The experimental realization of PCR amplification, achieved
through replacement of the DNA template by the treatment of pure water with
electromagnetic signals recorded from viral and bacterial DNA solutions, is
found consistent with the gauge theory paradigm of quantum fields.

1804.03139,2018-05-09,Non-hermitian operator modelling of basic cancer cell dynamics,"  We propose a dynamical system of tumor cells proliferation based on
operatorial methods. The approach we propose is quantum-like: we use ladder and
number operators to describe healthy and tumor cells birth and death, and the
evolution is ruled by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian which includes, in a non
reversible way, the basic biological mechanisms we consider for the system. We
show that this approach is rather efficient in describing some processes of the
cells. We further add some medical treatment, described by adding a suitable
term in the Hamiltonian, which controls and limits the growth of tumor cells,
and we propose an optimal approach to stop, and reverse, this growth.

  aspects","  All known life forms are based upon a hierarchy of interwoven feedback loops,
operating over a cascade of space, time and energy scales. Among the most basic
loops are those connecting DNA and proteins. For example, in genetic networks,
DNA genes are expressed as proteins, which may bind near the same genes and
thereby control their own expression. In this molecular type of self-reference,
information is mapped from the DNA sequence to the protein and back to DNA.
There is a variety of dynamic DNA-protein self-reference loops, and the purpose
of this remark is to discuss certain geometrical and physical aspects related
to the back and forth mapping between DNA and proteins. The discussion raises
basic questions regarding the nature of DNA and proteins as self-referring
matter, which are examined in a simple toy model.

1804.04500,2018-04-13,Can the light be used to treat obesity and diabetes?,"  The treatment of obesity and diabetes remains a challenge and the biological
mechanisms of these diseases are still not fully understood. Diabetes and
obesity are associated with increased risk of the development of cardiovascular
complications and there is an urgent need to find novel therapeutic approaches
for treating obesity and diabetes. Currently there are several approaches to
treat these diseases. Among them chemical uncouplers could be used as an
effective treatment for obesity but the dangerous side effects of these
compounds has limited their use in vivo. Here we propose a novel theoretical
model based on the mechanism of action of chemical uncouplers: the
thermogenin-like system (TLS). The TLS may be used in vivo to reproduce the
mechanism of action of chemical uncouplers but without their dangerous side
effects.

cell respiration intensity determined by the formation level of carbon dioxide.
We constructed the phase-parametric characteristic of the consumption of a
substrate by a cell depending on the intensity of the metabolic process of
formation of the final product of the oxidation. The scenarios of all possible
oscillatory modes of the system are constructed and studied. The bifurcations

  syst{\`e}mes de logement","  Assessment of the motor activity of group-housed sows in commercial farms.
The objective of this study was to specify the level of motor activity of
pregnant sows housed in groups in different housing systems. Eleven commercial
farms were selected for this study. Four housing systems were represented:
small groups of five to seven sows (SG), free access stalls (FS) with exercise
area, electronic sow feeder with a stable group (ESFsta) or a dynamic group
(ESFdyn). Ten sows in mid-gestation were observed in each farm. The
observations of motor activity were made for 6 hours at the first meal or at
the start of the feeding sequence, two consecutive days and at regular
intervals of 4 minutes. The results show that the motor activity of
group-housed sows depends on the housing system. The activity is higher with
the ESFdyn system (standing: 55.7%), sows are less active in the SG system
(standing: 26.5%), and FS system is intermediate. The distance traveled by sows
in ESF system is linked to a larger area available. Thus, sows travel an
average of 362 m $\pm$ 167 m in the ESFdyn system with an average available
surface of 446 m${}^2$ whereas sows in small groups travel 50 m $\pm$ 15 m for
15 m${}^2$ available.

1805.06487,2019-01-16,"Evolution of macromolecular structure: a 'double tale' of biological
  accretion","  The evolution of structure in biology is driven by accretion and change.
Accretion brings together disparate parts to form bigger wholes. Change
provides opportunities for growth and innovation. Here we review patterns and
processes that are responsible for a 'double tale' of evolutionary accretion at
various levels of complexity, from proteins and nucleic acids to high-rise
building structures in cities. Parts are at first weakly linked and associate
variously. As they diversify, they compete with each other and are selected for
performance. The emerging interactions constrain their structure and
associations. This causes parts to self-organize into modules with tight
linkage. In a second phase, variants of the modules evolve and become new parts
for a new generative cycle of higher-level organization. Evolutionary genomics
and network biology support the 'double tale' of structural module creation and
validate an evolutionary principle of maximum abundance that drives the gain
and loss of modules.

overall loss of terrestrial ecosystem production and biodiversity due to the
forest fire. The current research focuses on assessing the impact of forest
fire severity on terrestrial ecosystem productivity using different burn
indices in Uttarakhand, India. Satellite-based land surface temperature (LST)
was calculated for pre-fire (2014) and fire (2016) year using MODerate
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to identify the burn area hotspots
across all eco-regions in Uttarakhand. In this study, spatial and temporal
changes of different vegetation and burn area indices i.e Normalized Burn Ratio
(NBR), Burnt Area Index (BAI), Normalized Multiband Drought Index (NMDI), Soil
Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI),
Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
(NDVI)were estimated for both pre-fire and fire years. Additionally, two Light
Use Efficiency (LUE) models i.e Carnegie- Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) and
Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) were selected to quantify the terrestrial
Net Primary Productivity (NPP) in pre-fire and fire years across all biomes of
the study area.The present approach appears to be promising and has a potential
in quantifying the loss of ecosystem productivity due to forest fires. A
detailed field observation data is required for further training, and testing
of remotely sensed fire maps for future research.

1806.05547,2018-06-15,Analyzing counterintuitive data,"  Purpose: To explore the issue of counterintuitive data via analysis of a
representative case and further discussion of those situations in which the
data appear to be inconsistent with current knowledge. Case: 844 postoperative
CABG patients, who were extubated within 24 hours of surgery were identified in
a critical care database (MIMIC-III). Nurse elicited pain scores were
documented throughout their hospital stay on a scale of 0 to 10. Levels were
tracked as mean, median, and maximum values, and categorized as no (0/10), mild
(1-3), moderate (4-6) and severe pain (7-10). Regression analysis was employed
to analyze the relationship between pain scores and outcomes of interest
(mortality and hospital LOS). After covariate adjustment, increased levels of
pain were found to be associated with lower mortality rates and reduced
hospital LOS. Conclusion: These counterintuitive results for post-CABG pain
related outcomes have not been previously reported. While not representing
strong enough evidence to alter clinical practice, confirmed and reliable
results such as these should serve as a research trigger and prompt further
studies into unexpected associations between pain and patient outcomes. With
the advent of frequent secondary analysis of electronic health records, such
counterintuitive data results are likely to become more frequent. We discuss
the issue of counterintuitive data in extended fashion, including possible
reasons for, and approaches to, this phenomenon.

1806.08179,2018-06-22,"Classification of red blood cell shapes in flow using outlier tolerant
  machine learning","  The manual evaluation, classification and counting of biological objects
demands for an enormous expenditure of time and subjective human input may be a
source of error. Investigating the shape of red blood cells (RBCs) in
microcapillary Poiseuille flow, we overcome this drawback by introducing a
convolutional neural regression network for an automatic, outlier tolerant
shape classification. From our experiments we expect two stable geometries: the
so-called `slipper' and `croissant' shapes depending on the prevailing flow
conditions and the cell-intrinsic parameters. Whereas croissants mostly occur
at low shear rates, slippers evolve at higher flow velocities. With our method,
we are able to find the transition point between both `phases' of stable shapes
which is of high interest to ensuing theoretical studies and numerical
simulations. Using statistically based thresholds, from our data, we obtain
so-called phase diagrams which are compared to manual evaluations.
Prospectively, our concept allows us to perform objective analyses of
measurements for a variety of flow conditions and to receive comparable
results. Moreover, the proposed procedure enables unbiased studies on the
influence of drugs on flow properties of single RBCs and the resulting
macroscopic change of the flow behavior of whole blood.

  Systems such as the Proteome","  The CoHSI (Conservation of Hartley-Shannon Information) distribution is at
the heart of a wide-class of discrete systems, defining the length distribution
of their components amongst other global properties. Discrete systems such as
the known proteome where components are proteins, computer software, where
components are functions and texts where components are books, are all known to
fit this distribution accurately. In this short paper, we explore its solution
and its resulting properties and lay the foundation for a series of papers
which will demonstrate amongst other things, why the average length of
components is so highly conserved and why long components occur so frequently
in these systems. These properties are not amenable to local arguments such as
natural selection in the case of the proteome or human volition in the case of
computer software, and indeed turn out to be inevitable global properties of
discrete systems devolving directly from CoHSI and shared by all. We will
illustrate this using examples from the Uniprot protein database as a prelude
to subsequent studies.

1807.03784,2018-07-12,Observations and perspectives on the diversification of genomes,"  Rich information on the prebiotic evolution is still stored in contemporary
genomic data. The statistical mechanism at the sequence level may play a
significant role in the prebiotic evolution. Based on statistical analysis of
genome sequences, it has been observed that there is a close relationship
between the evolution of the genetic code and the organisation of genomes. A
biodiversity space for species is constructed based on comparing the
distributions of codons in genomes for different species according to
recruitment order of codons in the prebiotic evolution, by which a closely
relationship between the evolution of the genetic code and the tree of life has
been confirmed. On one hand, the three domain tree of life can be reconstructed
according to the distance matrix of species in this biodiversity space, which
supports the three-domain tree rather than the eocyte tree. On the other hand,
an evolutionary tree of codons can be obtained by comparing the distributions
of the 64 codons in genomes, which agrees with the recruitment order of codons
on the roadmap. This is a simple phylogenomic method to study the origins of
metazoan, the evolution of primates, etc. This study should be regarded as an
exploratory attempt to explain the diversification of the three domains of life
by statistical mechanism in prebiotic sequence evolution. It is indicated that
the number of bases in the triplet codons might be explained statistically by
the number of strands in the triplex DNAs. The adaptation of life to the
changing environment might be due to assembly of redundant genomes at the
sequence level.

1807.04665,2018-07-13,Observations and perspectives on the prebiotic sequence evolution,"  The post-genomic era has brought opportunities to bridge traditionally
separate fields of early history of life and brought new insight into origin
and evolution of biodiversity. According to distributions of codons in genome
sequences, I found a relationship between the genetic code and the tree of
life. This remote and profound relationship involves the origin and evolution
of the genetic code and the diversification and expansion of genomes. Here, a
prebiotic picture of the triplex nucleic acid evolution is proposed to explain
the origin of the genetic code, where the transition from disorder to order in
the origin of life might be due to the increasing stabilities of triplex base
pairs. The codon degeneracy can be obtained in detail based on the coevolution
of the genetic code with amino acids, or equivalently, the coevolution of tRNAs
with aaRSs. This theory is based on experimental data such as the stability of
triplex base pairs and the statistical features of genomic codon distributions.
Several experimentally testable proposals have been developed. This study
should be regarded as an exploratory attempt to reveal the early evolution of
life based on sequence information in a statistical manner.

  clouds darken the night sky in rural areas","  Artificial light at night has affected most of the natural nocturnal
landscapes worldwide and the subsequent light pollution has diverse effects on
flora, fauna and human well-being. To evaluate the environmental impacts of
light pollution, it is crucial to understand both the natural and artificial
components of light at night under all weather conditions. The night sky
brightness for clear skies is relatively well understood and a reference point
for a lower limit is defined. However, no such reference point exists for
cloudy skies. While some studies have examined the brightening of the night sky
by clouds in urban areas, the published data on the (natural) darkening by
clouds is very sparse. Knowledge of reference points for the illumination of
natural nocturnal environments however, is essential for experimental design
and ecological modeling to assess the impacts of light pollution. Here we use
differential all-sky photometry with a commercial digital camera to investigate
how clouds darken sky brightness at two rural sites. The spatially resolved
data enables us to identify and study the nearly unpolluted parts of the sky
and to set an upper limit on ground illumination for overcast nights at sites
without light pollution.

1808.05766,2018-08-20,The Function Transformation Omics - Funomics,"  There are no two identical leaves in the world, so how to find effective
markers or features to distinguish them is an important issue. Function
transformation, such as f(x,y) and f(x,y,z), can transform two, three, or
multiple input/observation variables (in biology, it generally refers to the
observed/measured value of biomarkers, biological characteristics, or other
indicators) into a new output variable (new characteristics or indicators).
This provided us a chance to re-cognize objective things or relationships
beyond the original measurements. For example, Body Mass Index, which transform
weight and high into a new indicator BMI=x/y^2 (where x is weight and y is
high), is commonly used in to gauge obesity. Here, we proposed a new system,
Funomics (Function Transformation Omics), for understanding the world in a
different perspective. Funome can be understood as a set of math functions
consist of basic elementary functions (such as power functions and exponential
functions) and basic mathematical operations (such as addition, subtraction).
By scanning the whole Funome, researchers can identify some special functions
(called handsome functions) which can generate the novel important output
variable (characteristics or indicators). We also start ""the Funome project"" to
develop novel methods, function library and analysis software for Funome
studies. The Funome project will accelerate the discovery of new useful
indicators or characteristics, will improve the utilization efficiency of
directly measured data, and will enhance our ability to understand the world.

1809.04171,2018-09-13,From Natural to Artificial Camouflage: Components and Systems,"  We identify the components of bio-inspired artificial camouflage systems
including actuation, sensing, and distributed computation. After summarizing
recent results in understanding the physiology and system-level performance of
a variety of biological systems, we describe computational algorithms that can
generate similar patterns and have the potential for distributed
implementation. We find that the existing body of work predominately treats
component technology in an isolated manner that precludes a material-like
implementation that is scale-free and robust. We conclude with open research
challenges towards the realization of integrated camouflage solutions.

  Laplace transformation and Homotopy analysis method","  The aim of this paper is to find the approximate solution of HIV infection
model of CD4+T cells. For this reason, the homotopy analysis transform method
(HATM) is applied. The presented method is combination of traditional homotopy
analysis method (HAM) and the Laplace transformation. The convergence of
presented method is discussed by preparing a theorem which shows the
capabilities of method. The numerical results are shown for different values of
iterations. Also, the regions of convergence are demonstrated by plotting
several h-curves. Furthermore in order to show the efficiency and accuracy of
method, the residual error for different iterations are presented.

1809.07247,2018-09-20,Time to Stop Telling Biophysics Students that Light is Primarily a Wave,"  Standard pedagogy introduces optics as though it were a consequence of
Maxwell's equations, and only grudgingly admits, usually in a rushed aside,
that light has a particulate character that can somehow be reconciled with the
wave picture. Recent revolutionary advances in optical imaging, however, make
this approach more and more unhelpful: How are we to describe two-photon
imaging, FRET, localization microscopy, and a host of related techniques to
students who think of light primarily as a wave? I was surprised to find that
everything I wanted my biophysics students to know about light, including image
formation, x-ray diffraction, and even Bessel beams, could be expressed as well
(or better) from the quantum viewpoint pioneered by Richard Feynman. Even my
undergraduate students grasp this viewpoint as well as (or better than) the
traditional one, and by mid-semester they are already well positioned to
integrate the latest advances into their understanding. Moreover, I have found
that this approach clarifies my own understanding of new techniques.

  Biochemical Knowledge","  Hexoses are simple sugars that play a key role in many cellular pathways, and
in the regulation of development and disease mechanisms. Current protein-sugar
computational models are based, at least partially, on prior biochemical
findings and knowledge. They incorporate different parts of these findings in
predictive black-box models. We investigate the empirical support for
biochemical findings by comparing Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) induced
rules to actual biochemical results. We mine the Protein Data Bank for a
representative data set of hexose binding sites, non-hexose binding sites and
surface grooves. We build an ILP model of hexose-binding sites and evaluate our
results against several baseline machine learning classifiers. Our method
achieves an accuracy similar to that of other black-box classifiers while
providing insight into the discriminating process. In addition, it confirms
wet-lab findings and reveals a previously unreported Trp-Glu amino acids
dependency.

1810.08614,2018-10-23,CoHSI III: Long proteins and implications for protein evolution,"  The length distribution of proteins measured in amino acids follows the CoHSI
(Conservation of Hartley-Shannon Information) probability distribution. In
previous papers we have verified various predictions of this using the Uniprot
database but here we explore a novel predicted relationship between the longest
proteins and evolutionary time. We demonstrate from both theory and experiment
that the longest protein and the total number of proteins are intimately
related by Information Theory and we give a simple formula for this. We stress
that no evolutionary explanation is necessary; it is an intrinsic property of a
CoHSI system. While the CoHSI distribution favors the appearance of proteins
with fewer than 750 amino acids (characteristic of most functional proteins or
their constituent domains) its intrinsic asymptotic power-law also favors the
appearance of unusually long proteins; we predict that there are as yet
undiscovered proteins longer than 45,000 amino acids. In so doing, we draw an
analogy between the process of protein folding driven by favorable pathways (or
funnels) through the energy landscape of protein conformations, and the
preferential information pathways through which CoHSI exerts its constraints in
discrete systems.
  Finally, we show that CoHSI predicts the recent appearance in evolutionary
time of the longest proteins, specifically in eukaryotes because of their
richer unique alphabet of amino acids, and by merging with independent
phylogenetic data, we confirm a predicted consistent relationship between the
longest proteins and documented and potential undocumented mass extinctions.

  criterion for life is a growing open system that performs self-assembly
  processes)","  For more than 100 years, humanity (both specialists and enthusiastic laics)
has been searching for extraterrestrial life hoping we are not alone. The first
step in the quest for extraterrestrial life is to define what and where exactly
to look for. Thus, the basic definition of living matter is a conditio sine qua
non for the quest. The diversity of species on Earth is so large that our quest
for extraterrestrial life cannot be limited to forms and shapes present and
known to us from our environment. However, there are two formal conditions that
must be fulfilled in order for something to be assumed as living matter. First,
it should represent a growing open thermodynamic system (in biological terms -
a cell), and thus be a system out of equilibrium. Second, it must perform
synthesis, self-assembly and accumulation processes (in biological terms to
grow, maintain homeostasis, respond to environment, reproduce, exchange matter
and energy, evolve). Populated planets are consisted of two components:
biosphere and its environment (geosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere). Living
matter and its environment are out of equilibrium. Thus, the candidate planets
are dynamic inhomogeneous systems for two reasons. First, a planet receives
energy from its star, which leads to disequilibrium for external reasons.
Animate matter contributes to disequilibrium for internal reasons: accumulation
of matter and self-assembly. In practice, for a screening, an astrobiologist
should search for increase in inhomogeneity on a candidate planet.

which, paraphrasing the late Per Bak, ""is screaming to be answered but seldom

1811.02478,2019-03-19,"Proofs of life: molecular-biology reasoning simulates cell behaviors
  from first principles","  We axiomatize the molecular-biology reasoning style, show compliance of the
standard reference: Ptashne, A Genetic Switch, and present proof-theory-induced
technologies to help infer phenotypes and to predict life cycles from
genotypes. The key is to note that `reductionist discipline' entails
constructive reasoning: any proof of a compound property can be decomposed to
proofs of constituent properties. Proof theory makes explicit the inner
structure of the axiomatized reasoning style and allows the permissible
dynamics to be presented as a mode of computation that can be executed and
analyzed. Constructivity and execution guarantee simulation when working over
domain-specific languages. Here, we exhibit phenotype properties for genotype
reasons: a molecular-biology argument is an open-system concurrent computation
that results in compartment changes and is performed among processes of
physiology change as determined from the molecular programming of given DNA.
Life cycles are the possible sequentializations of the processes. A main
implication of our construction is that formal correctness provides a
complementary perspective on science that is as fundamental there as for pure
mathematics. The bulk of the presented work has been verified formally correct
by computer.

1811.02526,2018-11-07,"CoHSI IV: Unifying Horizontal and Vertical Gene Transfer - is Mechanism
  Irrelevant ?","  In previous papers we have described with strong experimental support, the
organising role that CoHSI (Conservation of Hartley-Shannon Information) plays
in determining important global properties of all known proteins, from defining
the length distribution, to the natural emergence of very long proteins and
their relationship to evolutionary time. Here we consider the insight that
CoHSI might bring to a different problem, the distribution of identical
proteins across species. Horizontal and Vertical Gene Transfer (HGT/VGT) both
lead to the replication of protein sequences across species through a diversity
of mechanisms some of which remain unknown. In contrast, CoHSI predicts from
fundamental theory that such systems will demonstrate power law behavior
independently of any mechanisms, and using the Uniprot database we show that
the global pattern of protein re-use is emphatically linear on a log-log plot
(adj. $R^{2} = 0.99, p < 2.2 \times 10^{-16}$ over 4 decades); i.e. it is
extremely close to the predicted power law. Specifically we show that over 6.9
million proteins in TrEMBL 18-02 are re-used, i.e. their sequence appears
identically in between 2 and 9,812 species, with re-used proteins varying in
length from 7 to as long as 14,596 amino acids. Using (DL+V) to denote the
three domains of life plus viruses, 21,676 proteins are shared between two
(DL+V); 22 between three (DL+V) and 5 are shared in all four (DL+V). Although
the majority of protein re-use occurs between bacterial species those proteins
most frequently re-used occur disproportionately in viruses, which play a
fundamental role in this distribution.
  These results suggest that diverse mechanisms of gene transfer (including
traditional inheritance) are irrelevant in determining the global distribution
of protein re-use.

age is only reference level VII (17 406 years BP), it is classified as the
largest collection of fossils accumulated for our archipelago, produced by
trophic action of barn owls for thousands of years. The aim of this study was
to determine the living taxonomic composition of the fauna of extinct mammals,
and throughout the paleontological study of the deeper level of said tank
(Level IX). The extracted material which it is currently stored in the
warehouse of paleontological collections of the National Museum of Natural
History in Havana, Cuba (MNHNCu) was analyzed. We proceeded to clean the bones,
to classify and to identify them from the species and also the taphonomic
analysis of the condition of the remains. It was found that the mammal fauna of
the paleontological deposit under study is composed essentially of 3 orders, 7
families and 14 species. The most significative order is Chiroptera (bat
fauna), represented by 4 families, 9 genus and 9 species of the total which
were identified. There were reported four species of bats Erophylla sezecorni,
Monophyllus redmani, Pteronotus parnelli and Tadarida brasiliensis in the
location. The results are the basis of the future paleoecological studies in
order to reconstruct the natural history of these species. Moreover, the
discovery of new species in this area is a contribution to the knowledge about
the distribution of these species in the Cuban archipelago and the age of them.
Finally, the taphonomic analysis of the conservation status of these remains
permitted the understanding of the processes that gave rise to the tank and its
characteristics, and also it contribute to an adequate estimation of the

1812.07522,2019-09-18,"Low-temperature marginal ferromagnetism explains anomalous scale-free
  correlations in natural flocks","  We introduce a new ferromagnetic model capable of reproducing one of the most
intriguing properties of collective behaviour in starling flocks, namely the
fact that strong collective order of the system coexists with scale-free
correlations of the modulus of the microscopic degrees of freedom, that is the
birds' speeds. The key idea of the new theory is that the single-particle
potential needed to bound the modulus of the microscopic degrees of freedom
around a finite value, is marginal, that is has zero curvature. We study the
model by using mean-field approximation and Monte Carlo simulations in three
dimensions, complemented by finite-size scaling analysis. While at the standard
critical temperature, $T_c$, the properties of the marginal model are exactly
the same as a normal ferromagnet with continuous symmetry-breaking, our results
show that a novel zero-temperature critical point emerges, so that in its
deeply ordered phase the marginal model develops divergent susceptibility and
correlation length of the modulus of the microscopic degrees of freedom, in
complete analogy with experimental data on natural flocks of starlings.

1901.04053,2019-04-23,Moonshots for aging,"  As the global population ages, there is increased interest in living longer
and improving one's quality of life in later years. However, studying aging -
the decline in body function - is expensive and time-consuming. And despite
research success to make model organisms live longer, there still aren't really
any feasible solutions for delaying aging in humans. With space travel,
scientists couldn't know what it would take to get to the moon. They had to
extrapolate from theory and shorter-range tests. Perhaps with aging, we need a
similar moonshot philosophy. And though ""shot"" might imply medicine, perhaps we
need to think beyond biological interventions. Like the moon, we seem a long
way away from provable therapies to increase human healthspan (the healthy
period of one's life) or lifespan (how long one lives). This review therefore
focuses on radical proposals. We hope it might stimulate discussion on what we
might consider doing significantly differently than ongoing aging research.

of leaves and the root of Nicotiana tabacum, the stems and tubers of Solanum
tuberosum and the stems of pea Pisum sativum were examined by scanning probe
microscopy (in atomic force and magnetic power modes), and it was found that
the BMNs are located in the form of chains in the wall of the phloem sieve
tubes (ie, the vascular tissue of plants). Such a localization of BMNs supports
the idea that the chains of BMNs in different organs of plants have common
metabolic functions. Stray gradient magnetic fields about several thousand Oe,
which are created by chains of BMNs, can significantly affect the processes of
mass transfer near the membrane of vesicles, granules, organelles, structural
elements of the membrane, and others. This process is enhanced in plants when
artificial magnetite is added to the soil.

total of 120 P. aeruginosa isolates were obtained from both paediatric and
adult patients of Selayang Hospital, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Phenotypic methods
were used to detect various virulence factors (Phospholipase, Hemolysin,
Gelatinase, DNAse, and Biofilm). All the isolates were evaluated for production

  Categorizing and Clustering","  Background: In organisms' genomes, promoters are short DNA sequences on the
upstream of structural genes, with the function of controlling genes'
transcription. Promoters can be roughly divided into two classes: constitutive
promoters and inducible promoters. Promoters with clear functional annotations
are practical synthetic biology biobricks. Many statistical and machine
learning methods have been introduced to predict the functions of candidate
promoters. Spectral Eigenmap has been proved to be an effective clustering
method to classify biobricks, while support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful
machine learning algorithm, especially when dataset is small. Methods: The two
algorithms: spectral embedding and SVM are applied to the same dataset with 375
prokaryotic promoters. For spectral embedding, a Laplacian matrix is built with
edit distance, followed by K-Means Clustering. The sequences are represented by
numeric vector to serve as dataset for SVM trainning. Results: SVM achieved a
high predicting accuracy of 93.07% in 10-fold cross validation for
classification of promoters' transcriptional functions. Laplacian eigenmap
(spectral embedding) based on editing distance may not be capable for
extracting discriminative features for this task.

1902.06390,2019-02-19,Towards peptide strings pharmacology,"  Peptide strings have been developed as a concept for the past fourteen years.
They are proposed to basically entail various quantum states engendered by the
physical interactions of proteins containing peptide portions that are similar
to one another and, moreover, amino acid sequences that are sterically
complementary to each other. In this survey, additional insights are presented
that support the notion that peptide strings are likely a biophysical
phenomenon that warrants further investigations. Specifically, these putative
peptide strings traits are the capacity for wave-like interferences and
electric current-like properties. Therefore, future experimental validation and
quantification of these predicted features as well as application of this
potential energy that is stored in the distinct shapes of proteins and peptides
may prove beneficial in addressing challenges in physics and medicine. Within
the latter field, the key discipline of pharmacology should be most
fundamentally advanced by the peptide strings approach.

1902.09360,2019-02-26,"CoHSI V: Identical multiple scale-independent systems within genomes and
  computer software","  A mechanism-free and symbol-agnostic conservation principle, the Conservation
of Hartley-Shannon Information (CoHSI) is predicted to constrain the structure
of discrete systems regardless of their origin or function. Despite their
distinct provenance, genomes and computer software share a simple structural
property; they are linear symbol-based discrete systems, and thus they present
an opportunity to test in a comparative context the predictions of CoHSI. Here,
without any consideration of, or relevance to, their role in specifying
function, we identify that 10 representative genomes (from microbes to human)
and a large collection of software contain identically structured nested
subsystems. In the case of base sequences in genomes, CoHSI predicts that if we
split the genome into n-tuples (a 2-tuple is a pair of consecutive bases; a
3-tuple is a trio and so on), without regard for whether or not a region is
coding, then each collection of n-tuples will constitute a homogeneous discrete
system and will obey a power-law in frequency of occurrence of the n-tuples. We
consider 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- and 8-tuples of ten species and demonstrate
that the predicted power-law behavior is emphatically present, and furthermore
as predicted, is insensitive to the start window for the tuple extraction i.e.
the reading frame is irrelevant.
  We go on to provide a proof of Chargaff's second parity rule and on the basis
of this proof, predict higher order tuple parity rules which we then identify
in the genome data.
  CoHSI predicts precisely the same behavior in computer software. This
prediction was tested and confirmed using 2-, 3- and 4-tuples of the
hexadecimal representation of machine code in multiple computer programs,
underlining the fundamental role played by CoHSI in defining the landscape in
which discrete symbol-based systems must operate.

1903.07456,2020-06-04,Self-Organization and Artificial Life,"  Self-organization can be broadly defined as the ability of a system to
display ordered spatio-temporal patterns solely as the result of the
interactions among the system components. Processes of this kind characterize
both living and artificial systems, making self-organization a concept that is
at the basis of several disciplines, from physics to biology and engineering.
Placed at the frontiers between disciplines, Artificial Life (ALife) has
heavily borrowed concepts and tools from the study of self-organization,
providing mechanistic interpretations of life-like phenomena as well as useful
constructivist approaches to artificial system design. Despite its broad usage
within ALife, the concept of self-organization has been often excessively
stretched or misinterpreted, calling for a clarification that could help with
tracing the borders between what can and cannot be considered
self-organization. In this review, we discuss the fundamental aspects of
self-organization and list the main usages within three primary ALife domains,
namely ""soft"" (mathematical/computational modeling), ""hard"" (physical robots),
and ""wet"" (chemical/biological systems) ALife. We also provide a classification
to locate this research. Finally, we discuss the usefulness of
self-organization and related concepts within ALife studies, point to
perspectives and challenges for future research, and list open questions. We

bodyweight. Powerlifting is divided to equipped and RAW types. Pro RAW
powerlifting competitions use the Wilks scoring system to compare and rank
powerlifting results across bodyweights, to choose the winners. The Wilks
formulas are 5th order polynomials fitted to equipped powerlifting results from
the years 1987 - 1994. The Wilks formulas were meant to be updated every 2 to 5
years, but have never been revised. This study aims to update the Wilks scoring
system for use in pro RAW powerlifting.
  Methods: The 10 highest RAW powerlifting totals per weight class for
bodyweights 60 - 175 kg for men, and 44 kg and up for women, were collected
from the openpowerlifting.org database. Polynomials were fitted to these data
separately for men and women, using polynomial regression. The scores for men
and women were calculated using these fits, and the results are assessed.
  Results: 4th order polynomials were chosen for best describing the dependence
of powerlifting total result on bodyweight. The mens scores were normalized to
500 points, and womens to 455 points, on those fitted curves, to bring the top
scores to the same level across weight classes of each sex. These scores
appeared similar across the different weight classes for both men and women.
This even scoring across body weights is here considered the single most
important characteristic of a scoring system for pro competitions.

  Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis method (INAA) in Arak, Iran","  In this work, the specific mass of twelve elements were determined in five of
the most commonly used medicinal plants as Caraway (Carum carvi), Savory
(Satureia hortensis), Purslane (Portulaca oleracea), Fenugreek (Trigonella
foenum-graecum) and Milk thistle (Silibum marianum) prepared from herbal
pharmacies. Multi elemental Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA)
method was applied to analyze the samples. Tehran research reactor was used as
a neutron source and gamma ray spectra registered using high purity germanium
(HPGe) detector. Among analyzed samples, highest concentrations of Fe (8789
ppm), Cr (8 ppm) and Na (517 ppm) were found in Caraway. Maximum levels of Mn
(95 ppm), Cl (3702 ppm), Ca (18328 ppm) , K (21562 ppm) and V (2.7 ppm) were
detected in Savory and Fenugreek contains the lowest concentrations of Fe (195
ppm), Zn (13 ppm), Ca (2243 ppm), Al (99ppm), Mn (26 pm) and Mg (177ppm).

  Isolates of Escherichia Coli in a Tertiary Care Hospital, Malaysia","  The multidrug resistant Escherichia coli strains causes multiple clinical
infections and has become a rising problem globally. The
metallo-\b{eta}-lactamases encoding genes are very severe in gram-negative
bacteria especially E. coli. This study was aimed to evaluate the prevalence of
MBLs among the clinical isolates of E. coli. A total of 65 E. coli isolates
were collected from various clinical samples of Malaysian patients with
bacterial infections. The conventional microbiological test was performed for
isolation and identification of E. coli producing MBLs strains in this
vicinity. Multidrug Resistance (MDR) of E. coli isolates were assessed using
disk diffusion test. Phenotypic methods, as well as genotypic- PCR methods,
were performed to detect the presence of metallo-\b{eta}-lactamase resistance
genes (blaIMP, blaVIM) in imipenem resistant strains. Out of 65 E. coli
isolates, 42 isolates (57.3%) were MDR. The isolates from urine (19) produced
significantly more MDR (10) isolates than other sources. Additionally, 19
(29.2%) imipenem resistant E. coli isolates contained 10 MBLs gene, 7(36.8%)
isolates contained blaIMP and 3(15.7%) isolates contained blaVIM genes. This
study revealed the significant occurrence of MBL producing E. coli isolates in
clinical specimens and its association with health risk factors indicating an
alarming situation in Malaysia. It demands an appropriate concern to avoid
failure of treatments and infection control management.

1904.07860,2019-04-18,Base spacing distribution analysis for human genome,"  The distribution of bases spacing in human genome was investigated. An
analysis of the frequency of occurrence in the human genome of different
sequence lengths flanked by one type of nucleotide was carried out showing that
the distribution has no self-similar (fractal) structure. The results
nevertheless revealed several characteristic features: (i) the distribution for
short-range spacing is quite similar to the purely stochastic sequences; (ii)
the distribution for long-range spacing essentially deviates from the random
sequence distribution, showing strong long-range correlations; (iii) the
differences between (A, T) and (C, G) bases are quite significant; (iv) the
spacing distribution displays tiny oscillations.

1904.10375,2019-09-23,Morphogenesis Software based on Epigenetic Code Concept,"  The process of morphogenesis is an evolution of the shape of an organism
together with the differentiation of its parts. This process encompasses
numerous biological processes ranging from embryogenesis to regeneration
following crisis such as amputation or transplantation. A fundamental
theoretical question is where exactly do these instructions for
(re-)construction reside and how are they implemented? We have recently
proposed a set of concepts, aiming to respond to these questions and to provide
an appropriate mathematical formalization of the geometry of morphogenesis [1].
First, we consider the possibility that evolution of shape is determined by
epigenetic information, responsible for realization of different types of cell
events. Second, we suggest a set of rules for converting this epigenetic
information into instructive signals for cell events for each cell, as well as
for transforming it after each cell event. Next we give notions of cell state,
determined by its epigenetic array, and cell event, which is a change of cell
state, and formalize development as a graph (tree) of cell states connected by
5 types of cell events, corresponding to the processes of cell division, cell
growth, cell death, cell movement and cell differentiation. Here we present a
Morphogenesis Software capable of simulating the evolution of a 3D embryo
starting from zygote, following a set of rules based on our theoretical
assumptions, and thus to provide a proof-of-concept for the hypothesis of
epigenetic code regulation. The software creates a developing embryo and a
corresponding graph of cell events according to the zygotic epigenetic spectrum
and chosen parameters of the developmental rules. Variation of rules
influencing the resulting shape of an embryo may help elucidating the principal
laws underlying pattern formation.

1905.03611,2019-05-10,"Effect of E-cigarette Use and Social Network on Smoking Behavior Change:
  An agent-based model of E-cigarette and Cigarette Interaction","  Despite a general reduction in smoking in many areas of the developed world,
it remains one of the biggest public health threats. As an alternative to
tobacco, the use of electronic cigarettes (ECig) has been increased
dramatically over the last decade. ECig use is hypothesized to impact smoking
behavior through several pathways, not only as a means of quitting cigarettes
and lowering risk of relapse, but also as both an alternative nicotine delivery
device to cigarettes, as a visible use of nicotine that can lead to imitative
behavior in the form of smoking, and as a gateway nicotine delivery technology
that can build high levels of nicotine tolerance and pave the way for
initiation of smoking. Evidence regarding the effect of ECig use on smoking
behavior change remains inconclusive. To address these challenges, we built an
agent-based model (ABM) of smoking and ECig use to examine the effects of ECig
use on smoking behavior change. The impact of social network (SN) on the
initiation of smoking and ECig use were also explored. Findings from the
simulation suggest that the use of ECig generates substantially lower
prevalence of current smoker (PCS), which demonstrates the potential for
reducing smoking and lowering the risk of relapse. The effects of
proximity-based influences within SN increases the prevalence of current ECig
user (PCEU). The model also suggests the importance of improved understanding
of drivers in cessation and relapse in ECig use, in light of findings that such
aspects of behavior change may notably influence smoking behavior change and
burden.

1905.09104,2019-05-23,A Prerequisite for Life,"  The complex physicochemical structures and chemical reactions in living
organism have some common features: (1) The life processes take place in the
cytosol in the cells, which, from a physicochemical point of view is an
emulsion of biomolecules in a dilute aqueous suspension. (2) All living systems
are homochiral with respect to the units of amino acids and carbohydrates, but
(some) proteins are chiral unstable in the cytosol. (3) And living organism are
mortal. These three common features together give a prerequisite for the
prebiotic self-assembly at the start of the Abiogenesis. Here we argue , that
it all together indicates, that the prebiotic self-assembly of structures and
reactions took place in a more saline environment, whereby the homochirality of
proteins not only could be obtained, but also preserved. A more saline
environment for the prebiotic self-assembly of organic molecules and
establishment of biochemical reactions could have been the hydrothermal vents.

  need for a 'mechanism-plus-X' framework","  Ever since the advent of molecular biology in the 1970s, mechanical models
have become the dogma in the field, where a ""true"" understanding of any subject
is equated to a mechanistic description. This has been to the detriment of the
biomedical sciences, where, barring some exceptions, notable new feats of
understanding have arguably not been achieved in normal and disease biology,
including neurodegenerative disease and cancer pathobiology. I argue for a
""mechanism-plus-X"" paradigm, where mainstay elements of mechanistic models such
as hierarchy and correlation are combined with nomological principles such as
general operative rules and generative principles. Depending on the question at
hand and the nature of the inquiry, X could range from proven physical laws to
speculative biological generalizations, such as the notional principle of
cellular synchrony. I argue that the ""mechanism-plus-X"" approach should
ultimately aim to move biological inquiries out of the deadlock of
oft-encountered mechanistic pitfalls and reposition biology to its former
capacity of illuminating fundamental truths about the world.

1906.00787,2021-02-03,The behaviour of information flow near criticality,"  Recent experiments have indicated that many biological systems self-organise
near their critical point, which hints at a common design principle. While it
has been suggested that information transmission is optimized near the critical
point, it remains unclear how information transmission depends on the dynamics
of the input signal, the distance over which the information needs to be
transmitted, and the distance to the critical point. Here we employ stochastic
simulations of a driven 2D Ising system and study the instantaneous mutual
information and the information transmission rate between a driven input spin
and an output spin. The instantaneous mutual information varies
non-monotonically with the temperature, but increases monotonically with the
correlation time of the input signal. In contrast, the information transmission
rate exhibits a maximum as a function of the input correlation time. Moreover,
there exists an optimal temperature that maximizes this maximum information
transmission rate. It arises from a tradeoff between the necessity to respond
fast to changes in the input so that more information per unit amount of time
can be transmitted, and the need to respond to reliably. The optimal
temperature lies above the critical point, but moves towards it as the distance
between the input and output spin is increased.

1906.01464,2019-06-05,Studies on Bone-mass Formation within a Theoretical Model,"  Bone-mass formation in human is looked at to understand the underlying
dynamics with an eye on healing of bone-fracture and non-unions in non-invasive
pathways. Three biological cells osteoblasts, osteoclasts and osteocytes are
important players in creating new bone or osseous matter in which quite a few
hormones, proteins and minerals have indispensable supportive role. Assuming
populations of the three mentioned cells as variables, we frame a theoretical
model which is represented as a set of time differential equations. These
equations imitate the dynamic process of bone matter creation. High value of
osteocytes with moderate level values of osteoblast and osteoclast, all at
asymptotic scale, imply creation of new bone-matter in our model. The model is
studied both analytically and numerically. Some important results are
highlighted and relevant predictions are made which could be put to future
experimental test.

1906.07564,2019-06-19,Measuring Time with Minimal Clocks,"  Being able to measure time, whether directly or indirectly, is a significant
advantage for an organism. It allows for the timely reaction to regular or
predicted events, reducing the pressure for fast processing of sensory input.
Thus, clocks are ubiquitous in biology. In the present paper, we consider
minimal abstract pure clocks in different configurations and investigate their
characteristic dynamics. We are especially interested in optimally
time-resolving clocks. Among these, we find fundamentally diametral clock
characteristics, such as oscillatory behavior for purely local time measurement
or decay-based clocks measuring time periods of a scale global to the problem.
We include also sets of independent clocks (""clock bags""), sequential cascades
of clocks and composite clocks with controlled dependency. Clock cascades show
a ""condensation effect"" and the composite clock shows various regimes of
markedly different dynamics.

1907.03119,2019-07-09,"Investigating some attributes of periodicity in DNA sequences via
  semi-Markov modelling","  DNA segments and sequences have been studied thoroughly during the past
decades. One of the main problems in computational biology is the
identification of exon-intron structures inside genes using mathematical
techniques. Previous studies have used different methods, such as Fourier
analysis and hidden-Markov models, in order to be able to predict which parts
of a gene correspond to a protein encoding area. In this paper, a semi-Markov
model is applied to 3-base periodic sequences, which characterize the
protein-coding regions of the gene. Analytic forms of the related probabilities
and the corresponding indexes are provided, which yield a description of the
underlying periodic pattern. Last, the previous theoretical results are
illustrated with DNA sequences of synthetic and real data.

1907.05529,2019-09-09,"A Model-Theoretic Approach to Modular Implementation, with Application
  to Biological Systems","  We present a method for logical specification of the behavior of a system
based on the specification of its components and for representing and
specifying the effect of a class of communication ""signaling pathways"" among
them. Variations in the actions and effects (semantics) of the pathways can be
seen in the resulting system. We show how to ""enrich"" the behavior of the
original components by exactly what is provided by the signaling pathways. This
has the potential to allow a formal proof of a property of the system as a
whole, or a formal diagnosis why a system of communicating modules may not
satisfy a desired specification, and if and how it can be ""fixed."" There are
five distinct stages in our view: 1. A description of the connections between
potential components at the level of which potential modules are connected. 2.
Specific choices for those modules 3. An ""elaboration"" of the connections among
different modules to connections among members of those different modules 4. A
description of the semantics of those connections (what they actually do) 5. A
""padding"" of the modules chosen in step 2 to allow for the action of the
connections (step 3), as described in step 4. The formalism is completely
hierarchical -- in other words, the formalism works equally for the system as a
whole, for each of the modules, and for any larger system in which the original
system is a component. As it turns out, for whatever reason -- perhaps
evolutionary advantage optimization at the right level of abstraction -- many
biological systems are hierarchically modular, with the modules communicating
via various pathways. Thus, a formalism such as the one presented here could
have application to questions in biology.

1907.13472,2019-08-07,Is type 1 diabetes a chaotic phenomenon?,"  A database of ten type 1 diabetes patients wearing a continuous glucose
monitoring device has enabled to record their blood glucose continuous
variations every minute all day long during fourteen consecutive days. These
recordings represent, for each patient, a time series consisting of 1 value of
glycaemia per minute during 24 hours and 14 days, i.e., 20,160 data point.
Thus, while using numerical methods, these time series have been anonymously
analyzed. Nevertheless, because of the stochastic inputs induced by daily
activities of any human being, it has not been possible to discriminate chaos
from noise. So, we have decided to keep only the 14 nights of these ten
patients. Then, the determination of the time delay and embedding dimension
according to the delay coordinate embedding method has allowed us to estimate
for each patient the correlation dimension and the maximal Lyapunov exponent.
This has led us to show that type 1 diabetes could indeed be a chaotic
phenomenon. Once this result has been confirmed by the determinism test, we
have computed the Lyapunov time and found that the limit of predictability of
this phenomenon is nearly equal to half the 90-minutes sleep-dream cycle. We
hope that our results will prove to be useful to characterize and predict blood
glucose variations.

tensegrity-mechanotransduction theory of Ingber, the study of these
electromagnetically induced mechanical forces could be, in our opinion, a
powerful tool to understand some effects of the electromagnetic stimulation
whose mechanisms remain still elusive.

1908.01472,2022-05-12,On the theoretical prediction of microalgae growth for parallel flow,"  The established microalgae growth models are semi-empirical or considerable
fitting coefficients exist currently. Therefore, the ability of the model
prediction is reduced by the numerous fitting coefficients. Furthermore, the
predicted results of the established models are dependent on the size of the
photobioreactor (PBR), light intensity, flow and concentration field. The
growth mechanism of microalgae has not clearly understood in PBR cultivation.
It is difficult to predict the microalgae growth by theoretical methods, owing
to the aforementioned factors. We developed an exploratory bridging microalgae
growth model to predict the microalgae growth rate in PBRs by using the
nondimensional method which is effectively in fluid dynamics and heat transfer.
The analytical solution of the growth rate was obtained for the parallel flow.
The nondimensional growth rate expressed as function of Reynolds number and
Schmidt number, which can be used for arbitrary parallel flow due to the
solution was expressed as nondimensional quantities. The theoretically
predicted growth rate is compared with the experimentally measured microalgae
growth rate on the order of magnitude. The nondimensional method successfully
applied to the microalgae growth problem for the first time. The general
nondimensional solution can unify the numerous experimental data for different
laboratory conditions, and give a direction for the disorder of the microalgae
growth problem. The nondimensional solution may be useful to explain the growth
mechanism of microalgae and design large-scale PBRs for microalgae biofuel
production. The significance of the work is to give a theoretical foundation
and methodology of biological theory of microalgae growth.

1908.03342,2019-08-12,A New Framework For Spatial Modeling And Synthesis of Genome Sequence,"  This paper provides a framework in order to statistically model sequences
from human genome, which is allowing a formulation to synthesize gene
sequences. We start by converting the alphabetic sequence of genome to decimal
sequence by Huffman coding. Then, this decimal sequence is decomposed by HP
filter into two components, trend and cyclic. Next, a statistical modeling,
ARIMA-GARCH, is implemented on trend component exhibiting heteroskedasticity,
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) to capture the linear
characteristics of the sequence and later, generalized autoregressive
conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) is then appropriated for the statistical
nonlinearity of genome sequence. This modeling approach synthesizes a given
genome sequence regarding to its statistical features. Finally, the PDF of a
given sequence is estimated using Gaussian mixture model and based on estimated
PDF, we determine a new PDF presenting sequences that counteract statistically
the original sequence. Our strategy is performed on several genes as well as
HIV nucleotide sequence and corresponding results is presented.

1908.06746,2020-11-09,Maize Yield and Nitrate Loss Prediction with Machine Learning Algorithms,"  Pre-season prediction of crop production outcomes such as grain yields and N
losses can provide insights to stakeholders when making decisions. Simulation
models can assist in scenario planning, but their use is limited because of
data requirements and long run times. Thus, there is a need for more
computationally expedient approaches to scale up predictions. We evaluated the
potential of five machine learning (ML) algorithms as meta-models for a
cropping systems simulator (APSIM) to inform future decision-support tool
development. We asked: 1) How well do ML meta-models predict maize yield and N
losses using pre-season information? 2) How many data are needed to train ML
algorithms to achieve acceptable predictions?; 3) Which input data variables
are most important for accurate prediction?; and 4) Do ensembles of ML
meta-models improve prediction? The simulated dataset included more than 3
million genotype, environment and management scenarios. Random forests most
accurately predicted maize yield and N loss at planting time, with a RRMSE of
14% and 55%, respectively. ML meta-models reasonably reproduced simulated maize
yields but not N loss. They also differed in their sensitivities to the size of
the training dataset. Across all ML models, yield prediction error decreased by
10-40% as the training dataset increased from 0.5 to 1.8 million data points,
whereas N loss prediction error showed no consistent pattern. ML models also
differed in their sensitivities to input variables. Averaged across all ML
models, weather conditions, soil properties, management information and initial
conditions were roughly equally important when predicting yields. Modest
prediction improvements resulted from ML ensembles. These results can help
accelerate progress in coupling simulation models and ML toward developing
dynamic decision support tools for pre-season management.

Agar disc diffusion tests were carried out to determine the antimicrobial
effects of ethanolic, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts of B.
monnieri against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923),
Gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922) bacterial strains and antifungal
strains (Aspergillus flavus, and Candida albicans). Among the various extracts,
diethyl ether extracts of B. monnieri has an antibacterial potency against
Staphylococcus aureus (gram positive), and ethyl acetate extract showed effects
on E. coli (gram negative) at higher concentrations of 300 microgam mL-1. The
ethanolic extract has potent antifungal activity against the fungus
(Aspergillus flavus, and Candida albicans) compared to diethyl ether and ethyl
acetate-ether. Both extracts (diethyl ether and ethyl acetate) has a minimum
antifungal effect while these extracts showed more inhibitory effects on tested
bacteria. Inhibitory effects of the aqueous extract were not observed at all
concentration (100 microgam mL-1, 200 microgam mL-1and 300 microgam mL-1)
against the entire examined bacterial and fungal species. The finding of this
study indicates the antibacterial and antifungal activity exhibited by the
ethanolic, diethyl ether, and ethyl acetate extract of B. monnieri can be
validated to the management of medicinal plant throughout the world.

demonstrate convergence of the genetic code to a near universal solution. We
reproduce and analyze the algorithm as a dynamical system. All the parameters
used in the model are varied to assess their impact on convergence and
optimality score. We show that by allowing specific parameters to vary with
time, the solution exhibits attractor dynamics. Finally, we study automorphisms
of the genetic code arising due to this model. We use this to examine the
scaling of the solutions in order to re-examine universality and find that
there is a direct link to mutation rate.

1909.13574,2019-10-01,"DNA coding and G\""odel numbering","  Evolution consists of distinct stages: cosmological, biological, linguistic.
Since biology verges on natural sciences and linguistics, we expect that it
shares structures and features from both forms of knowledge. Indeed, in DNA we
encounter the biological ""atoms"", the four nucleotide molecules. At the same
time these four nucleotides may be considered as the ""letters"" of an alphabet.
These four ""letters"", through a genetic code, generate biological ""words"",
""phrases"", ""sentences"" (aminoacids, proteins, cells, living organisms). In this
spirit we may consider equally well a DNA strand as a mathematical statement.
Inspired by the work of Kurt G\""odel, we attach to each DNA strand a G\""odel's
number, a product of prime numbers raised to appropriate powers. To each DNA
chain corresponds a single G\""odel's number $G$, and inversely given a
G\""odel's number $G$, we can specify the DNA chain it stands for. Next,
considering a single DNA strand composed of $N$ bases, we study the statistical
distribution of $g$, the logarithm of $G$. Our assumption is that the choice of
the $m$-th term is random and with equal probability for the four possible
outcomes. The ""experiment"", to some extent, appears as throwing $N$ times a
four-faces die. Through the moment generating function we obtain the discrete
and then the continuum distribution of $g$. There is an excellent agreement
between our formalism and simulated data. At the end we compare our formalism
to actual data, to specify the presence of traces of non-random dynamics.

1910.03129,2019-10-09,"Maize yield under a changing climate: The hidden role of vapor pressure
  deficit","  Temperatures over the next century are expected to rise to levels detrimental
to crop growth and yield. As the atmosphere warms without additional water
vapor input, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) increases as well. Increased
temperatures and accompanied elevated VPD levels can both lead to negative
impacts on crop yield. The independent importance of VPD, however, is often
neglected or conflated with that from temperature due to a tight correlation
between the two climate factors. We used a coupled process-based crop (MAIZSIM)
and soil (2DSOIL) model to gain a mechanistic understanding of the independent
roles temperature and VPD play in crop yield projections, as well as their
interactions with rising CO2 levels and changing precipitation patterns. We
found that by separating out the VPD effect from rising temperatures, VPD
increases had a greater negative impact on yield compared to that from warming.
The negative impact of these two factors varied with precipitation levels and
influenced yield through separate mechanisms. Warmer temperatures caused yield
loss mainly through shortening the growing season, while elevated VPD increased
water loss and triggered several water stress responses such as reduced
photosynthetic rates, lowered leaf area development, and shortened growing
season length. Elevated CO2 concentrations partially alleviated yield loss
under warming or increased VPD conditions through water savings, but the impact
level varied with precipitation levels and was most pronounced under drier
conditions. These results demonstrate the key role VPD plays in crop growth and
yield, displaying a magnitude of impact comparative to temperature and CO2. A
mechanistic understanding of the function of VPD and its relation with other
climate factors and management practices is critical to improving crop yield
projections under a changing climate.

  PhotoPlethysmoGraphic signal a case study","  In the analysis of biological time series, the state space comprises a
framework for the study of systems with presumably deterministic properties.
However, a physiological experiment typically captures an observable, or, in
other words, a series of scalar measurements that characterize the temporal
response of the physiological system under study; the dynamic variables that
make up the state of the system at any time are not available. Therefore, only
from the acquired observations should state vectors reconstructed to emulate
the different states of the underlying system. It is what is known as the
reconstruction of the state space, called phase space in real-world signals,
for now only satisfactorily resolved using the method of delays. Each state
vector consists of m components, extracted from successive observations delayed
a time t. The morphology of the geometric structure described by the state
vectors, as well as their properties, depends on the chosen parameters t and m.
The real dynamics of the system under study is subject to the correct
determination of the parameters t and m. Only in this way can be deduced
characteristics with true physical meaning, revealing aspects that reliably
identify the dynamic complexity of the physiological system. The biological
signal presented in this work, as a case study, is the PhotoPlethysmoGraphic
(PPG) signal. We find that m is five for all the subjects analyzed and that t
depends on the time interval in which it evaluates. The H\'enon map and the
Lorenz flow are used to facilitate a more intuitive understanding of applied
techniques.

1910.11507,2019-10-28,Possible traces of resonance signaling in the genome,"  Although theories regarding the role of sequence-specific DNA resonance in
biology have abounded for over 40 years, the published evidence for it is
lacking. Here, the authors reasoned that for sustained resonance signaling, the
number of oscillating DNA sequences per genome should be exceptionally high and
that, therefore, genomic repeats of various sizes are good candidates for
serving as resonators. Moreover, it was suggested that for the two DNA
sequences to resonate, they do not necessarily have to be identical. Therefore,
the existence of sequences differing in the primary sequence but having similar
resonating sub-structures was proposed. It was hypothesized that such
sequences, named HIDERs, would be enriched in the genomes of multicellular
species. Specifically, it was hypothesized that delocalized electron clouds of
purine-pyrimidine sequences could serve as the basis of HIDERs. The consequent
genomic analysis confirmed the enrichment of purine-pyrimidine HIDERs in a few
selected genomes of mammals, an insect, and a plant, compared to randomized
sequence controls. Similarly, it was suggested that hypothetical delocalized
proton clouds of the hydrogen bonds of multiple stacked bases could serve as
sequence-dependent hydrogen-bond-based HIDERs. Similarly, the enrichment of
such HIDERs was observed. It is suggested that these enrichments are the first
evidence in support of sequence-specific resonance signaling in the genome.

1911.02346,2019-11-07,Knockdown of human AMPK using the CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing system,"  AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a critical energy sensor, regulating
signaling networks involved in pathology including metabolic diseases and
cancer. This increasingly recognized role of AMPK has prompted tremendous
research efforts to develop new pharmacological AMPK activators. To precisely
study the role of AMPK, and the specificity and activity of AMPK activators in
cellular models, genetic AMPK inactivating tools are required. We report here
methods for genetic inactivation of AMPK $\alpha1/ \alpha2$ catalytic subunits
in human cell lines by the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, a recent breakthrough
technique for genome editing.

1911.02995,2019-11-11,"Considerations for Using the Vasculature as a Coordinate System to Map
  All the Cells in the Human Body","  Several ongoing international efforts are developing methods of localizing
single cells within organs or mapping the entire human body at the single cell
level, including the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's Human Cell Atlas (HCA), and
the Knut and Allice Wallenberg Foundation's Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and the
National Institutes of Health's Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP).
Their goals are to understand cell specialization, interactions, spatial
organization in their natural context, and ultimately the function of every
cell within the body. In the same way that the Human Genome Project had to
assemble sequence data from different people to construct a complete sequence,
multiple centers around the world are collecting tissue specimens from a
diverse population that varies in age, race, sex, and body size. A challenge
will be combining these heterogeneous tissue samples into a 3D reference map
that will enable multiscale, multidimensional Google Maps-like exploration of
the human body. Key to making alignment of tissue samples work is identifying
and using a coordinate system called a Common Coordinate Framework (CCF), which
defines the positions, or ""addresses"", in a reference body, from whole organs
down to functional tissue units and individual cells. In this perspective, we
examine the concept of a CCF based on the vasculature and describe why it would
be an attractive choice for mapping the human body.

1911.03509,2020-04-30,"If your P value looks too good to be true, it probably is: Communicating
  reproducibility and variability in cell biology","  The cell biology literature is littered with erroneously tiny P values, often
the result of evaluating individual cells as independent samples. Because
readers use P values and error bars to infer whether a reported difference
would likely recur if the experiment were repeated, the sample size N used for
statistical tests should actually be the number of times an experiment is
performed, not the number of cells (or subcellular structures) analyzed across
all experiments. P values calculated using the number of cells do not reflect
the reproducibility of the result and are thus highly misleading. To help
authors avoid this mistake, we provide examples and practical tutorials for
creating figures that communicate both the cell-level variability and the
experimental reproducibility.

1911.04329,2020-10-28,Tumor stabilization induced by T-cell recruitment fluctuations,"  The influence of random fluctuations on the recruitment of effector cells
towards a tumor is studied by means of a stochastic mathematical model.
Aggressively growing tumors are confronted against varying intensities of the
cell-mediated immune response for which chaotic and periodic oscillations
coexist together with stable tumor dynamics. A thorough parametric analysis of
the noise-induced transition from this oscillatory regime to complete tumor
dominance is carried out. A hysteresis phenomenon is uncovered, which
stabilizes the tumor at its carrying capacity and drives the healthy and the
immune cell populations to their extinction. Furthermore, it is shown that near
a crisis bifurcation such transitions occur under weak noise intensities.
Finally, the corresponding noise-induced chaos-order transformation is analyzed
and discussed in detail.

1911.10362,2019-12-02,"Effect of Copper Chemical Form on The Growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  Isolated from Burned Patients and on Its Cu Uptake","  The main object of this investigation was to shed light on the information on
the level of Cu uptake by Pseudomonas aeruginosa that has been previously
isolated from patients using Gram-negative E. aerogenes ans a Gram-positive
Bacillus thuringiensis as a control for Cu uptake measurements. Cu uptake data
showed that maximum Cu uptake was obtained by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The
metal uptake was dependent on the type of biosorbent with different
accumulation affinities toward the tested chemical form of the copper. Cells
harvested at exponential growth phase showed slightly higher Cu uptake than at
stationary phase, which reflect that the Cu uptake is metabolism
dependent-process. The increasing order of affinity of the cupric chloride and
cupric sulphate towards the three genera were almost constant. However, where
cupric nitrate was used, the copper uptake behavior in Pseudomonas aeroginosa
was not changed from those results with the other two chemical forms, whereas
with E. aerogenes & B. thuringiensis, different Cu uptake behaviors were
observed. In B. thuengenesis, the copper uptake rate as a function of initial
Cu concentration were shown to increase with increasing the initial
concentration of Cu, constantly above 320 ppm as compared with others. In
Enterobacter with cupric nitrate, different bahavior was also shown in which
the copper uptake decline sharply beyond the 320 ppm. These results reflect
that the Cu uptake in P. aeruginosa is with different mechanisms as compared
with other tested bacteria.

pose a risk of infection. This quantitative study aims to see a description of
the characteristics of post partum maternal perineal wounds with infrared
therapy twice a day for three consecutive days with a descriptive analytic
analysis design. Sample selection technique with purposive sampling in post
partum mothers with spontaneous parturition, 1-2 degrees of perineal wounds in
the amount of 20 people. Perineal wound characteristics were assessed and
observed using the Southampton instrument with the results of the instrument
trial r = 0.99 (Karl Pearson correlation coefficient), and the reliability
value of 0.99 (brown spearman). The results of this study showed that
degeneration of wounds was found only until the first day of post-intervention
(1.95 ), poor wound regeneration occurred until the second day of
pre-intervention (1.95), and wound regeneration was being encountered changes
from the first day to the second day pre-intervention (1.05). These results
indicate that infrared therapy does not show significant changes if only done
for one day.

1911.12363,2020-11-18,"Optimizing Energetic cost of Uncertainty in a Driven System With and
  Without Feedback","  Many biological functions require the dynamics to be necessarily driven
out-of-equilibrium. In contrast, in various contexts, a nonequilibrium dynamics
at fast timescales can be described by an effective equilibrium dynamics at a
slower timescale. In this work we study the two different aspects, (i) the
energy-efficiency tradeoff for a specific nonequilibrium linear dynamics of two
variables with feedback, and (ii) the cost of effective parameters in a
coarse-grained theory as given by the ""hidden"" dissipation and entropy
production rate in the effective equilibrium limit of the dynamics. To
meaningfully discuss the tradeoff between energy consumption and the efficiency
of the desired function, a one-to-one mapping between function(s) and energy
input is required. The function considered in this work is the variance of one
of the variables. We get a one-to-one mapping by considering the minimum
variance obtained for a fixed entropy production rate and vice-versa. We find
that this minimum achievable variance is a monotonically decreasing function of
the given entropy production rate. When there is a timescale separation, in the
effective equilibrium limit, the cost of the effective potential and
temperature is the associated ""hidden"" entropy production rate.

1912.00985,2019-12-03,"Improving polyhydroxyalkanoates production in phototrophic mixed
  cultures by optimizing accumulator reactor operating conditions","  Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) production with phototrophic mixed cultures
(PMCs) has been recently proposed. These cultures can be selected under the
permanent presence of carbon and the PHA production can be enhanced in
subsequent accumulation steps. To optimize the PHA production in accumulator
reactors, this work evaluated the impact of 1) initial acetate concentration,
2) light intensity, 3) removal of residual nitrogen on the culture performance.
Results indicate that low acetate concentration (<30CmM) and specific light
intensities around 20W/gX are optimal operating conditions that lead to high
polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) storage yields (0.83+-0.07 Cmol-PHB/Cmol-Acet) and
specific PHB production rates of 2.21+-0.07 Cmol-PHB/Cmol X d. This rate is
three times higher than previously registered in non-optimized accumulation
tests and enabled a PHA content increase from 15 to 30% in less than 4h. Also,
it was shown for the first time, the capability of a PMC to use a real waste,
fermented cheese whey, to produce PHA with a hydroxyvalerate (HV) content of
12%. These results confirm that fermented wastes can be used as substrates for
PHA production with PMCs and that the energy levels in sunlight that lead to
specific light intensities from 10 to 20W/gX are sufficient to drive
phototrophic PHA production processes.

1912.04949,2019-12-12,"Venue-based HIV testing at sex work hotspots to reach adolescent girls
  and young women living with HIV: a cross-sectional study in Mombasa, Kenya","  Background: We estimated the potential number of newly diagnosed HIV
infections among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) using a venue-based
approach to HIV testing at sex work hotspots.
  Methods: We used hotspot enumeration and cross-sectional bio-behavioural
survey data from the 2015 Transitions Study of AGYW aged 14-24 years who
frequented hotspots in Mombasa, Kenya. We compared the HIV cascade among AGYW
who sell sex (YSW, N=408) versus those who do not (NSW, N=891); and
triangulated the potential (100% test acceptance and accuracy) and feasible
(accounting for test acceptance and sensitivity) number of AGYW that could be
newly diagnosed via hotspot-based HIV rapid testing in Mombasa. We identified
the profile of AGYW recently tested for HIV (in the past year) using
multivariable logistic regression.
  Results: N=37/365 (10.1%) YSW and N=30/828 (3.6%) NSW were living with HIV,
of whom 27.0% (N=10/37) and 30.0% (N=9/30) were diagnosed and aware (p=0.79).
Rapid test acceptance was 89.3% and sensitivity was 80.4%. Hotspot enumeration
estimated 15,635 (range: 12,172-19,097) AGYW in hotspots in Mombasa. The
potential and feasible number of new diagnosis were 627 (310-1,081), and 450
(223-776), respectively. Thus, hotspot-based testing could feasibly reduce the
undiagnosed fraction from 71.6% to 20.2%. The profile of AGYW who recently
tested was similar among YSW and NSW. YSW were two-fold more likely to report a
recent HIV test after adjusting for other determinants [odds ratio (95% CI):
2.1 (1.6-3.1)].
  Conclusion: Reaching AGYW via hotspot-based HIV testing could fill gaps left
by traditional, clinic-based HIV prevention and testing services.

1912.07154,2019-12-17,"On the Order of Gene Distribution on Chromosomes Across the Animal
  Kingdom","  Background. The large-scale pattern of distribution of genes on the
chromosomes in the known animal genomes is not well characterized. We
hypothesized that individual genes will be distributed on chromosomes in a
mathematically ordered manner across the animal kingdom. Results. Twenty-one
animal genomes reported in the NCBI database were examined. Numerically, there
was a trend towards increasing overall gene content with increasing size of the
genome as reflected by the chromosomal complement. Gene frequency on individual
chromosomes in each animal genome was analyzed and demonstrated uniformity of
proportions within each animal with respect to both average gene frequency on
individual chromosomes and gene distribution across the unique genomes.
Further, average gene distribution across animal species followed a
relationship whereby it was, approximately, inversely proportional to the
square root of the number of chromosomes in the unique animal genomes,
consistent with the notion that there is an ordered increase in gene dispersion
as the complexity of the genome increased. To further corroborate these
findings a derived measure, termed gene spacing on chromosomes correlated with
gene frequency and gene distribution. Conclusion. As animal species have
evolved, the distribution of their genes on individual chromosomes and within
their genomes, when viewed on a large scale is not random, but follows a
mathematically ordered process, such that as the complexity of the organism
increases, the genes become less densely distributed on the chromosomes and
more dispersed across the genome.

1912.07782,2020-08-13,Process simulation and optimization of agro-systems by DNDC model,"  Many people are still facing hunger and the global food shortages is still an
urgent problem. Meanwhile, global warming is still severe. Therefore, we
propose a simulation-based optimization approach for improving crop yield and
reducing the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) of agriculture system. We simulated
and verified the crop yield and carbon/nitrogen cycle with
Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model. A set of empirical equations of
DNDC model were selected and implemented in gPROMS for obtaining the optimal
solution of fertilizer usage. A case study shows that the optimized framework
improves crop yield by 18%, when 72.42kg N/ha urea was used. Meanwhile the GHG
emission of the system was reduced by 10%. The results show the necessity of
optimal planning and usage of fertilizer in agriculture system.
"
1912.08163,2019-12-30,Simple mathematical model of aging,"  A simple mathematical model of the aging process for long-lived organisms is
considered. The key point in this model is the assumption that the body does
not have internal clocks that count out the chronological time at scales of
decades. At these scales, we may limit ourselves by empirical consideration
only the background (smoothed, averaged) processes. The body is dealing with
internal biological factors, which can be considered as the biological clocks
in suitable parameterization of corresponding variables. The dynamics of these
variables is described using a system of autonomous ODEs. A particular
representation of the right-hand side of equations in the form of quadratic
polynomials is considered. In the simplest case of one variable we deal with a
logistic equation, which has an analytical solution. Such quadratic model is
justified if it is used to predict the dynamic of aging process for relatively
small time intervals. However, since a well-defined biological interpretation
can be given for the quadratic right-hand side of the equations, we can expect
that the area of applicability of this simplified empirical model can extend to
relatively large time intervals. The considered model is, in our opinion, a
good and simple mathematical framework for organizing experimental data. The
model may be useful to quantify and arrange the chains of causal relationships
that may appear significant for the development of the aging process.

1912.09001,2020-03-03,A framework for parsing heritable information,"  Living systems transmit heritable information using the replicating gene
sequences and the cycling regulators assembled around gene sequences. Here I
develop a framework for heredity and development that includes the cycling
regulators parsed in terms of what an organism can sense about itself and its
environment by defining entities, their sensors, and the sensed properties.
Entities include small molecules (ATP, ions, metabolites, etc.), macromolecules
(individual proteins, RNAs, polysaccharides, etc.), and assemblies of
molecules. While concentration may be the only relevant property measured by
sensors for small molecules, multiple properties that include concentration,
sequence, conformation, and modification may all be measured for macromolecules
and assemblies. Each configuration of these entities and sensors that is
recreated in successive generations in a given environment thus specifies a
potentially vast amount of information driving complex development in each
generation. This Entity-Sensor-Property framework explains how sensors limit
the number of distinguishable states, how distinct molecular configurations can
be functionally equivalent, and how regulation of sensors prevents detection of
some perturbations. Overall, this framework is a useful guide for understanding
how life evolves and how the storage of information has itself evolved with
complexity since before the origin of life.

2001.01109,2020-01-07,Natural intelligence and anthropic reasoning,"  This paper aims to justify the concept of natural intelligence, the type of
intelligence wider than human intelligence and its derivative, AI. I will argue
that the process of life is a cognitive process and that organisms, from
bacteria to animals, are cognitive agents. To justify these arguments, the
neural intelligence represented by the form of reasoning known as anthropic
reasoning will be compared and contrasted with types of intelligence explicated
by four disciplines of biology, relational biology, evolutionary epistemology,
biosemiotics and the systems view of life, not biased towards neural
intelligence. The comparison will be achieved by asking several questions that
probe the concepts of observers and true observers. To answer the questions I
will rely on a range of established concepts including SETI, Fermi's paradox,
bacterial cognition, versions of the panspermia theory, and some newly
introduced concepts including biocivilisations, cognitive universes, and the
cognitive multiverse. The key point emerging from the answers is that the
process of cognition, the essence of natural intelligence, is a biological
universal.

the biomedical community is increasingly dependent on computational tools, the
mechanisms ensuring open data, open software, and reproducibility are variably
enforced by academic institutions, funders, and publishers. Publications may
present academic software for which essential materials are or become

  Korean adults","  Objectives: This paper introduces a new method for evaluating fitness and
determining effective exercises for reducing abdominal obesity in Korean adults
using the new kind of waist-to-height ratio (WHT2R). Materials and Methods: The
body mass index (BMI), body shape index (ABSI), and two other waist-to-height
ratios (WHT.5R, WHTR) were considered as possible contenders for the WHT2R. The
correlation coefficients were calculated by correlation analyses between the
indices and four fitness tests for comparison. The LMV (lump mean value) and
FSPW (fitness sensitivity percentage to WHT2R) were introduced to find the
association between fitness and abdominal obesity using a linear regression
method and to use as an indicator for the effective control of abdominal
obesity. Results: The WHT2R is more suitable for assessing fitness than the
other indices and can be controlled effectively by decreasing the 10-m shuttle
run score for both males and females. Conclusions: The WHT2R can be used as a
possible contender for evaluating fitness and is an effective indicator for the
reduction of abdominal obesity. The LMV and FSPW can be used to establish
personal exercise aims.

2002.07112,2020-03-03,Artificial Intelligence Forecasting of Covid-19 in China,"  BACKGROUND An alternative to epidemiological models for transmission dynamics
of Covid-19 in China, we propose the artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired
methods for real-time forecasting of Covid-19 to estimate the size, lengths and
ending time of Covid-19 across China. METHODS We developed a modified stacked
auto-encoder for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics. We
applied this model to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19
across China. The data were collected from January 11 to February 27, 2020 by
WHO. We used the latent variables in the auto-encoder and clustering algorithms
to group the provinces/cities for investigating the transmission structure.
RESULTS We forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across
China from Jan 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Using the multiple-step forecasting,
the estimated average errors of 6-step, 7-step, 8-step, 9-step and 10-step
forecasting were 1.64%, 2.27%, 2.14%, 2.08%, 0.73%, respectively. We predicted
that the time points of the provinces/cities entering the plateau of the
forecasted transmission dynamic curves varied, ranging from Jan 21 to April 19,
2020. The 34 provinces/cities were grouped into 9 clusters. CONCLUSIONS The
accuracy of the AI-based methods for forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 was
high. We predicted that the epidemics of Covid-19 will be over by the middle of
April. If the data are reliable and there are no second transmissions, we can
accurately forecast the transmission dynamics of the Covid-19 across the
provinces/cities in China. The AI-inspired methods are a powerful tool for
helping public health planning and policymaking.

2002.07480,2020-02-19,Heart Rate Variability as an Indicator of Thermal Comfort State,"  Thermal comfort is a personal assessment of one's satisfaction with the
surroundings. Yet, most thermal comfort delivery mechanisms preclude
physiological and psychological precursors to thermal comfort. Accordingly,
many people feel either cold or hot in an environment that is supposedly
thermally comfortable to most people. To address this issue, this paper
proposes to use people's heart rate variability (HRV) as an alternative
indicator of thermal comfort. Since HRV is linked to homeostasis, we
hypothesize that it could be used to predict people's thermal comfort status.
To test our hypothesis, we analyzed statistical, spectral, and nonlinear HRV
indices of 17 human subjects doing light office work in a cold, a neutral, and
a hot environment. The resulting HRV indices were used as inputs to machine
learning classification algorithms. We observed that HRV is distinctively
altered depending on the thermal environment and that it is possible to
steadfastly predict each subject's thermal environment (cold, neutral, and hot)
with up to a 93.7% prediction accuracy. The result of this study implies that
it could be possible to design automatic real-Time thermal comfort controllers
based on people's HRV.

2002.12138,2022-07-11,The Chiral Puzzle of Life,"  Biological molecules chose one of two structurally, chiral systems which are
related by reflection in a mirror. It is proposed that this choice was made,
causally, by magnetically polarized and physically chiral cosmic-rays, which
are known to have a large role in mutagenesis. It is shown that the cosmic rays
can impose a small, but persistent, chiral bias in the rate at which they
induce structural changes in simple, chiral monomers that are the building
blocks of biopolymers. A much larger effect should be present with helical
biopolymers, in particular, those that may have been the progenitors of RNA and
DNA. It is shown that the interaction can be both electrostatic, just involving
the molecular electric field, and electromagnetic, also involving a magnetic
field. It is argued that this bias can lead to the emergence of a single,
chiral life form over an evolutionary timescale. If this mechanism dominates,
then the handedness of living systems should be universal. Experiments are
proposed to assess the efficacy of this process.

  Code?","  The genetic code is the function from the set of codons to the set of amino
acids by which a DNA sequence encodes proteins. Since the codons also influence
the shape of the DNA molecule itself, the same sequence that encodes a protein
also has a separate geometric interpretation. A question then arises: How
well-duplexed are these two ""codes""? In other words, in choosing a genetic
sequence to encode a particular protein, how much freedom does one still have
to vary the geometry (or vice versa). A recent paper by the first author
addressed this question using two different methods. After reviewing those
results, this paper addresses the same question with a third method: the use of
Monte Carlo and Gaussian sampling methods to approximate a multi-integral
representing the mutual information of a variety of possible genetic codes.
Once again, it is found that the genetic code used in nuclear DNA has a
slightly lower than average duplexing efficiency as compared with other
hypothetical genetic codes. A concluding section discusses the significance of
these surprising results.

  Anti-Pathogen Species (PIAPS) Levels: Modelling and Therapeutic Strategies","  Current CoVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly worldwide, and it may become
one of the largest pandemic events in modern history if out of control. It
appears most of the SARS-CoV2 virus infection resulted deaths are mainly due to
dysfunctions or failures of the lung or multiple organs that could be
attributed to hosts immunodysfunctions particularly hyperinflammatory type
disorders. In this brief review and study, a math model is proposed to
correlate the Pathogen Infection Recovery Probability (PIRP) versus
Proinflammatory Anti-Pathogen Species (PIAPS) levels within a host unit, where
a maximum PIRP is exhibited when the PIAPS levels are equal to or around PIAPS
equilibrium levels at the pathogen elimination or clearance onset. Based on
this model, rational or effective therapeutic strategies at right stages or
timing, with right type of agents (immuno-stimulators or immuno-suppressors),
and right dosages, may be designed and implemented that are expected to

  natural language processing related to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19","  Automated information extraction with natural language processing (NLP) tools
is required to gain systematic insights from the large number of COVID-19
publications, reports and social media posts, which far exceed human processing
capabilities. A key challenge for NLP is the extensive variation in terminology
used to describe medical entities, which was especially pronounced for this
newly emergent disease. Here we present an NLP toolbox comprising very large
English dictionaries of synonyms for SARS-CoV-2 (including variant names) and
COVID-19, which can be used with dictionary-based NLP tools. We also present a
silver standard corpus generated with the dictionaries, and a gold standard
corpus, consisting of PubMed abstracts manually annotated for disease, virus,
symptom, protein/gene, cell type, chemical and species terms, which can be used
to train and evaluate COVID-19-related NLP tools. Code for annotation, which
can be used to expand the silver standard corpus or for text mining is also
included. This toolbox is freely available on GitHub (on
https://github.com/Aitslab/corona) and zenodo
(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6642275). The toolbox can be used for a variety
of text analytics tasks related to the COVID-19 crisis and has already been
used to create a COVID-19 knowledge graph, study the variability and evolution
of COVID-19-related terminology and develop and benchmark text mining tools.

2003.11779,2020-07-21,"A Thermodynamic Approach towards the Question ""What is Cellular Life?""","  The question ""What is life?"" has been asked and studied by the researchers of
various fields. Nevertheless, no global theory which unified various aspects of
life has been proposed so far. Considering that the physical principle for the
theory of birth should be the one known for the unanimated world, and that the
life processes are irreversibly selective, we showed by a deductive inference
that the maximum entropy production principle plays an essential role for the
birth and the evolution of life in a fertile environment. In order to explain
the survival strategy of life in a barren period of environment, we also
proposed that life had simultaneously developed a reversible on and off
switching mechanism of the chemical reactions by the dynamics of equilibrium
thermodynamics. Thus, the birth and evolution of life have been achieved by the
cooperation between the driving force due to the non-equilibrium thermodynamics
and the protective force due to the equilibrium thermodynamics in the
alternating environmental conditions.

2003.12886,2020-04-01,SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) by the numbers,"  The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a harsh reminder of the fact that, whether
in a single human host or a wave of infection across continents, viral dynamics
is often a story about the numbers. In this snapshot, our aim is to provide a
one-stop, curated graphical source for the key numbers that help us understand
the virus driving our current global crisis. The discussion is framed around
two broad themes: 1) the biology of the virus itself and 2) the characteristics
of the infection of a single human host. Our one-page summary provides the key
numbers pertaining to SARS-CoV-2, based mostly on peer-reviewed literature. The
numbers reported in summary format are substantiated by the annotated
references below. Readers are urged to remember that much uncertainty remains
and knowledge of this pandemic and the virus driving it is rapidly evolving. In
the paragraphs below we provide ""back of the envelope"" calculations that
exemplify the insights that can be gained from knowing some key numbers and
using quantitative logic. These calculations serve to improve our intuition
through sanity checks, but do not replace detailed epidemiological analysis.

2003.12916,2020-04-02,Build-at-home UV-C disinfection system for healthcare settings,"  Significant research has shown that UV-C exposure is an effective
disinfectant for a range of bacteria and viruses, including coronaviruses. As
such, a UV-C treatment in combination with a chemical wipe, such as EPA
hydrogen peroxide, is a common cleaning protocol in a medical setting, and such
disinfection protocols have gained in importance during the current COVID-19
pandemic due to the need to reuse PPE. However, given the substantial increase
in patient volume, the quantity of materials requiring disinfection exceeds the
UV-C equipment throughput capabilities at many medical facilities. Therefore,
there is a need for a UV-C disinfection system that can be rapidly deployed. In
response to this demand, we designed, constructed, and validated a UV-C
disinfection system from readily accessible components; specifically, a plastic
bin, UV-C light bulb and conventional light housing. To further improve the
performance, the interior of the tub was spray-painted with chrome paint,
forming a low quality-factor (Q) Fabry-Perot optical cavity. As part of this
work, a set of modular design criteria which allows for flexibility in
component selection without degradation of UV-C dose performance is
established. This flexibility is critical given the current fluctuating
availability of source materials. The disinfection capabilities of the system
are validated using Bacillus cereus, a gram-positive endospore-forming
bacteria.

2003.13282,2020-03-31,"Accelerated infection testing at scale: a proposal for inference with
  single test on multiple patients","  In pandemics or epidemics, public health authorities need to rapidly test a
large number of individuals, both to determine the line of treatment as well as
to know the spread of infection to plan containment, mitigation and future
responses. However, the lack of adequate testing kits could be a bottleneck,
especially in the case of unanticipated new diseases, such as COVID-19, where
the testing technology, manufacturing capability, distribution, human skills
and laboratories might be unavailable or in short supply. In addition, the cost
of the standard PCR test is approximately USD 48, which is prohibitive for
poorer patients and most governments. We address this bottleneck by proposing a
test methodology that pools the sample from two (or more) patients in a single
test. The key insight is that a single negative result from a pooled sample
likely implies negative infection of all the individual patients. and It
thereby rules out further tests for the patients. This protocol, therefore,
requires significantly fewer tests. This may, however, result in somewhat
increased false negatives. Our simulations show that combining samples from two
patients with 7% underlying likelihood of infection implies that 36% fewer test
kits are required, with 14% additional units of time for testing.

2003.13473,2020-03-31,"Modern alleles in archaic human Y chromosomes support origin of modern
  human paternal lineages in Asia rather than Africa","  Recent studies have shown that hybridization between modern and archaic
humans was commonplace in the history of our species. After admixture, some
individuals with admixed autosomes carried the modern Homo Sapiens uniparental
DNAs, while the rest carried the archaic versions. Coevolution of admixed
autosomes and uniparental DNAs is expected to cause some of the sites in modern
uniparental DNAs to revert back to archaic alleles, while the opposite process
would occur (from archaic to modern) in some of the sites in archaic
uniparental DNAs. This type of coevolution is one of the elements that
differentiate the two different models of the Y phylogenetic tree of modern
humans, rooting it either in Africa or East Asia. The expected reversion to
archaic alleles is assumed to occur and is easily traceable in the Asia model,
but is absent in the Africa model due to its infinite site assumption, which
also precludes the independent or convergent mutation to modern alleles in
archaic uniparental DNAs since mutations are assumed to occur randomly across a
neutral genome, and convergent evolution is assumed not to occur. Here, we
examined newly published high coverage Y chromosome sequencing data of two
Denisovan and two Neanderthal samples to determine whether they carry
modern-Homo Sapiens alleles in sites where they are not supposed to according
to the Africa model. The results showed that a significant fraction of the
sites that, according to the Asia model, should differentiate the original
modern Y from the original archaic Y carried modern alleles in the archaic Y
samples here. Some of these modern alleles were shared among all archaic humans
while others could differentiate Denisovans from Neanderthals. The observation
is best accounted for by coevolution of archaic Y and admixed modern autosomes,
and hence supports the Asia model, since it takes such coevolution into
account.

2003.13890,2020-04-14,"Robust predictive model for Carriers, Infections and Recoveries (CIR):
  predicting death rates for CoVid-19 in Spain","  This article presents a new model to predict the evolution of infective
diseases under uncertainty or low-quality information, just as it has happened
in the initial scenario during the CoVid-19 spread in China and Europe. The
model has been used to predict the death rate in Spain but can be used to
predict the demand of ICUs or mechanical ventilators under different restraint
policies. The main novelty of the model is that it keeps track of the date of
infection of a single individual and uses stochastic distributions to aggregate
individuals who share the same date of infection. In addition, it uses two
types of infections, mild and serious, with a different recovery time. These
features are implemented in a set of differential equations which determine the
number of Carriers, Infections, Recoveries, Hospitalized and Deaths. Comparison
with real data shows good agreement.

the study of evolution. This is the first history of their study. They were
described by Lansdown Guilding (1797-1831). This paper identifies the landmarks
of their study, in a worldwide level, for almost 200 years. The beginning,
1826-1879, was based on describing their anatomy with light miscroscopy, mostly
by famous French naturalists such as Milne-Edwards and Blanchard. In 1880-1929
peiord, work concentrated in anatomy, physiology, behavior, biogeography and
ecology, but the most important work was Bouvier`s mammoth monograph. The next
period, 1930-1979, was important for the discovery of Cambrian species; Vachons
explanation of how ancient distribution defined the existence of two families;
Pioneer DNA and electron microscopy from Brazil; and primitive attempts at
systematics using embryology or isolated anatomical characteristics. Finally,
the 1980-2020 period, with research centered in Australia, Brazil, Costa Rica
and Germany, is marked by an evolutionary approach to everything, from body and
behavior to distribution; for the solution of the old problem of how they form
their adhesive net and how the glue works; the reconstruction of Cambrian
onychophoran communities, the first experimental taphonomy; the first
countrywide map of conservation status (from Costa Rica); the first model of
why they survive in cities; the discovery of new phenomena like food hiding,
parental feeding investment and ontogenetic diet shift; and for the birth of a

2004.01000,2020-06-23,"A Bayesian approach to recover the theoretical temperature-dependent
  hatch date distribution from biased samples: the case of the common
  dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus)","  Reproductive phenology, growth and mortality rates are key ecological
parameters that determine population dynamics and are therefore of vital
importance to stock assessment models for fisheries management. In many fish
species, the spawning phenology is sensitive to environmental factors that
modulate or trigger the spawning event, which differ between regions and
seasons. In addition, climate change may also alter patterns of reproductive
phenology at the community level. Usually, hatch-date distributions are
determined back-calculating the age estimated on calcified structures from the
capture date. However, these estimated distributions could be biased due to
mortality processes or time spaced samplings derived from fishery. Here, we
present a Bayesian approach that functions as a predictive model for the
hatching date of individuals from a fishery-dependent sampling with temporal
biases. We show that the shape and shift of the observed distribution is
corrected. This model can be applied in fisheries with multiple cohorts, for
species with a wide geographical distribution and living under contrasting
environmental regimes and individuals with different life histories such as
thermo-dependent growth, length-dependent mortality rates, etc.

  Silico Investigation","  COVID-19 has quickly spread across the globe, becoming a pandemic. This
disease has a variable impact in different countries depending on their
cultural norms, mitigation efforts and health infrastructure. In India, a
majority of people rely upon traditional Indian medicine to treat human
maladies due to less-cost, easier availability and without any side-effect.
These medicines are made by herbal plants. This study aims to assess the Indian
herbal plants in the pursuit of potential COVID-19 inhibitors using in silico
approaches. We have considered 18 extracted compounds of 11 different species
of these plants. Our calculated lipophilicity, aqueous solubility and binding
affinity of the extracted compounds suggest that the inhibition potentials in
the order; harsingar > aloe vera > giloy > turmeric > neem > ashwagandha > red
onion > tulsi > cannabis > black pepper. On comparing the binding affinity with
hydroxychloroquine, we note that the inhibition potentials of the extracts of
harsingar, aloe vera and giloy are very promising. Therefore, we believe that
these findings will open further possibilities and accelerate the works towards
finding an antidote for this malady.

2004.04567,2020-05-05,The pandemic of viruses with a long incubation phase in the small world,"  A model of the spread of viruses in selected city and in a network of cities
is considered, taking into account the delay caused by the long incubation
period of the virus. The effect of delay effects is shown in comparison with
pandemics without such delay. A temporary asymmetry of the spread of infection
has been identified, which means that the time for a pandemic to develop
significantly exceeds the time for its completion. Model calculations of the
spread of viruses in a network of interconnected large and small cities were
carried out, and dynamics features were revealed in comparison with the spread
of viruses in a single city, including the possibility of reinfection of
megalopolis.

2004.06111,2020-05-12,Open Data Resources for Fighting COVID-19,"  We provide an insight into the open data resources pertinent to the study of
the spread of Covid-19 pandemic and its control. We identify the variables
required to analyze fundamental aspects like seasonal behaviour, regional
mortality rates, and effectiveness of government measures. Open data resources,
along with data-driven methodologies, provide many opportunities to improve the
response of the different administrations to the virus. We describe the present
limitations and difficulties encountered in most of the open-data resources. To
facilitate the access to the main open-data portals and resources, we identify
the most relevant institutions, at a world scale, providing Covid-19
information and/or auxiliary variables (demographics, mobility, etc.). We also
describe several open resources to access Covid-19 data-sets at a country-wide
level (i.e. China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, U.S., etc.). In an attempt to
facilitate the rapid response to the study of the seasonal behaviour of
Covid-19, we enumerate the main open resources in terms of weather and climate
variables. CONCO-Team: The authors of this paper belong to the CONtrol COvid-19
Team, which is composed of different researches from universities of Spain,
Italy, France, Germany, United Kingdom and Argentina. The main goal of

2004.08553,2020-04-21,A new method for life table and life expectancy calculation,"  The existing life table method needs to calculate the age-specific mortality
first, not only has too many and complicated calculation steps, but also
introduces the multiple approximation to bring error. This paper redefines the
probability of death for the life table as the average probability of death of
a group of people born in a certain period at a later time. Based on this
definition, a new method for the life table is proposed to obtain the life
expectancy, which has the same meaning to that from the traditional life table.
Using the Japanese population data to verify the method, the results show that
it is consistent with the life expectancy of the birth of the baby, the maximum
relative difference is no more than 0.1%, and average relative difference is
less than 0.03%. The theory and method of life table described in this paper
are simple and easy to understand. The needed data are easy to obtained from
statistics, and the calculation is easy, the results obtained are accurate and
reliable. It should be a very valuable demographic method for application.

2004.09230,2020-04-21,"On the origin of the standard genetic code as a fusion of prebiotic
  single-base-pair codes","  The genesis of the stand genetic code is considered as a result of a fusion
of two AU- and GC-codes distributed in two dominant and two recessive domains.
The fusion of these codes is described with simple empirical rules. This formal
approach explains the number of the proteinogenic amino acids and the codon
assignment in the resulting standard genetic code. It shows how norleucine,
pyrrolysine, selenocysteine and two other unknown amino acids, included into
the prebiotic codes, disappeared after the fusion. The properties of these two
missing amino acids were described. The ambiguous translation observed in
mitochondria is explained. The internal structure of the codes allows a more
detailed insights into molecular evolution in prebiotic time. In particular,
the structure of the oldest single base-pair code is presented. The fusion
concept reveals the appearance of the DNA machinery on the level of the single
dominant AU-code. The time before the appearance of standard genetic code is
divided into four epochs: pre-DNA, 2-code, pre-fusion, and after-fusion epochs.
The prebiotic single-base-pair codes may help design novel peptide-based
catalysts.

  identified by complexity theory. An integrated methodology","  Complexity metrics and machine learning (ML) models have been utilized to
analyze the lengths of segmental genomic entities like: exons, introns,
intergenic and repeat/unique DNA sequences, in each of the 22 human
chromosomes. The purpose of the study was to assess information and order that
may be concealed within the size distribution of these sequences. For this
purpose, we developed an innovative integrated methodology. Our analysis is
based upon the reconstructed phase space theorem, the non-extensive statistical
theory of Tsallis, ML techniques and a new technical index, integrating the
generated information, which we introduce and named it Complexity Factor
(COFA). The low-dimensional deterministic nonlinear chaotic and non-extensive
statistical character of the DNA sequences was verified with strong
multifractal characteristics and long-range correlations with significant
variations per genomic entity and per chromosome. The results of the analysis
reveal changes in complexity behavior per genomic entity and chromosome
regarding the size distribution of individual genomic segment. The lengths of
intron regions show greater complexity behavior in all metrics than the exonic
ones, with longer range correlations, and stronger memory effects, for all
chromosomes. We conclude from our analysis, that the size distribution of the
genomic regions within chromosomes, are not random, but follow a specific
pattern with characteristic features, that have been seen here through its
complexity character, and it is part of the dynamics of the whole genome
according to complexity theory. This picture of dynamics of the redundancy of
information in DNA recognized from ML tools for clustering, classification and

2005.00082,2020-05-04,Software for Microscopy Workshop White Paper,"  Microscopes have morphed from purely optical instruments into motorized,
robotic machines that form images on digital sensors rather than eyeballs. This
continuing trend towards automation and digitization enables many new
approaches to microscopy that would have been impossible or impractical without
computer interfaces. Accordingly, todays development of new microscopes most
often depends on concurrent software development to bring these custom-build
systems to life. This dependence on software brings opportunities and
challenges. Most importantly, a key challenge while developing new microscopes
is to develop the appropriate software. Despite the fact that software is
easily copied and distributed, remarkably few opportunities are available to
share experiences creating microscope control software. In turn, this brings
challenges in creating maintainable and flexible software code and writing User
Interfaces (UIs) that are easily used by researchers, who are primarily life
scientists. To start to address these challenges by identifying common problems
and shared solutions, we assembled a small group of researchers that develop or
use software to control their custom-build microscopes at the Janelia Research
Campus for a two-day workshop in February 2020. The outcome of the workshop was
the definition of clear milestones, as well as the recognition of an involved
community, much larger than the one assembled at the workshop. This community
encounters similar hurdles and shares a great desire to overcome these by
stronger, community-wide collaborations on Open Source Software. This White
Paper summarizes the major issues identified, proposes approaches to address
these as a community, and outlines the next steps that can be taken to develop
a framework facilitating shared microscope software development, significantly
speeding up development of new microscopy systems.

necessitated the adequate understanding of the evolutionary pathway of zoonotic
viruses which adversely affects human populations for therapeutic constructs to
combat the pandemic now and in the future. We analyzed conserved domains of the
severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV2] for possible targets of
viral entry inhibition in host cells, evolutionary relationship of human
coronavirus [229E] and zoonotic coronaviruses with SAR-CoV2 as well as
evolutionary relationship between selected SARS-CoV 2 genomic data. Conserved
domains with antagonistic action on host innate antiviral cellular mechanisms
in SARS-CoV 2 include nsp 11, nsp 13 etc. Also, multiple sequence alignments of
the spike [S] gene protein of selected candidate zoonotic coronaviruses
alongside the S gene protein of the SARs-CoV2 revealed closest evolutionary
relationship [95.6%] with pangolin coronaviruses [S] gene. Clades formed
between Wuhan SARS-CoV2 phylogeny data and five others suggests viral entry
trajectory while revealing genomic and protein SARS CoV 2 data from Philippines
as early ancestors. Therefore, phylogeny of SARS-CoV 2 genomic data suggests
profiling in diverse populations with and without the outbreak alongside

2005.04005,2020-05-11,Biosignature Surveys to Exoplanet Yields and Beyond,"  Upcoming biosignature searches focus on indirect indicators to infer the
presence of life on other worlds. Aside from just signaling the presence of
life, however, some biosignatures can contain information about the state that
a planet's biosphere has achieved. This additional information can be used to
measure what fractions of planets achieve certain key stages, corresponding to
the advent of life, photosynthesis, multicellularity, and technological
civilization. We forecast the uncertainties of each measurement for upcoming
surveys, and outline the key factors that determine these uncertainties. Our
approach is probabilistic and relies on large numbers of candidates rather than
detailed examination of individual exoplanet spectra. The dependence on survey
size, likeliness of the transition, and several measures of degrees of
confidence are discussed, including discussion of geological false positives in
biosignatures as well as how combining data from different missions can affect
the inference. Our analysis should influence policy recommendations for future
mission design and strategy to minimize the impact of measurement
uncertainties.
"
2005.05656,2023-08-16,Life's mechanism,"  The multifarious internal workings of organisms are difficult to reconcile
with a single feature defining a state of being alive. Indeed, definitions of
life rely on emergent properties (growth, capacity to evolve, agency) only
symptomatic of intrinsic functioning. Empirical studies demonstrate that
biomolecules including ratcheting or rotating enzymes and ribozymes undergo
repetitive conformation state changes driven either directly or indirectly by
thermodynamic gradients. They exhibit disparate structures, but govern
processes relying on directional physical motion (DNA transcription,
translation, cytoskeleton transport) and share the principle of repetitive
uniplanar conformation changes driven by thermodynamic gradients, producing
dependable unidirectional motion: heat engines exploiting thermodynamic
disequilibria to perform work. Recognition that disparate biological molecules
demonstrate conformation state changes involving directional motion, working in
self-regulating networks, allows a mechanistic definition: life is a
self-regulating process whereby matter undergoes cyclic, uniplanar conformation
state changes that convert thermodynamic disequilibria into directed motion,
performing work that locally reduces entropy. Living things are structures
including an autonomous network of units exploiting thermodynamic gradients to
drive uniplanar conformation state changes that perform work. These principles
are independent of any specific chemical environment, and can be applied to
other biospheres.

the reason for infections of over 35 lakhs and the death of over 2 lakh human
beings. We propose a procedure to detect CoVID-19 affected localities using a
sewage mass testing and pooling mechanism which has gained ground in recent
times. The proposed method named Sewage Pooling Algorithm tests wastewater
samples from sewage systems to pinpoint the regions which are affected by
maximum chances of the virus spread. The algorithm also uses a priority-based
backtracking procedure to perform testing in sewage links depending on the
probability of infection in the sub-areas. For places with very rare CoVID
cases, we present a gradient-based search method to prune those areas. The
proposed method has less human intervention and increases the effective
tests/million people over current in-place methods.

2005.10227,2020-05-21,"Hemogram Data as a Tool for Decision-making in COVID-19 Management:
  Applications to Resource Scarcity Scenarios","  COVID-19 pandemics has challenged emergency response systems worldwide, with
widespread reports of essential services breakdown and collapse of health care
structure. A critical element involves essential workforce management since
current protocols recommend release from duty for symptomatic individuals,
including essential personnel. Testing capacity is also problematic in several
countries, where diagnosis demand outnumbers available local testing capacity.
This work describes a machine learning model derived from hemogram exam data
performed in symptomatic patients and how they can be used to predict qRT-PCR
test results. Methods: A Naive-Bayes model for machine learning is proposed for
handling different scarcity scenarios, including managing symptomatic essential
workforce and absence of diagnostic tests. Hemogram result data was used to
predict qRT-PCR results in situations where the latter was not performed, or
results are not yet available. Adjusts in assumed prior probabilities allow
fine-tuning of the model, according to actual prediction context. Proposed
models can predict COVID-19 qRT-PCR results in symptomatic individuals with
high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Data assessment can be performed in
an individual or simultaneous basis, according to desired outcome. Based on
hemogram data and background scarcity context, resource distribution is
significantly optimized when model-based patient selection is observed,
compared to random choice. The model can help manage testing deficiency and
other critical circumstances. Machine learning models can be derived from
widely available, quick, and inexpensive exam data in order to predict qRT-PCR
results used in COVID-19 diagnosis. These models can be used to assist
strategic decision-making in resource scarcity scenarios, including personnel
shortage, lack of medical resources, and testing insufficiency.

role in the spread of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for
the COVID-19 pandemic. The long persistence of viruses (hours to days) on

intercept virus transmission and the spread of the disease. Elucidating the
physicochemical processes and surface science underlying the adsorption and
transfer of virus between surfaces, as well as their inactivation, are
important in understanding how the disease is transmitted, and in developing
effective interception strategies. This review aims to summarize the current
knowledge and underlying physicochemical processes of virus transmission, in
particular via fomites, and common disinfection approaches. Gaps in knowledge
and needs for further research are also identified. The review focuses on

the process of angiogenesis by using 3D CA model. CA technique uses various
neighborhoods like Von-Neumann neighborhood, Moore neighborhood, and Margolus
neighborhood. In our model Von-Neumann neighborhood has used for distribution
of some significant chemical and non-chemical tumor angiogenic factors like
vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial cells, O2, extracellular
matrix, fibronectin, etc., and Moore neighborhood is used for distribution of
matrix metalloproteinase. In vivo tumor environment all the factors are not
distributed equally in the extracellular matrix. Distributions of those
chemical and nonchemical factors depend on their source, nature and function.
To keep similarity with the biological tumor environment, we have formulated
initial distributions of the chemical and non-chemical factors accordingly. We
have started the simulation in MATLAB with this initial distribution. Number of
sprouts randomly varies from one run to another. We observed that sprouts are
not originating from the same locations in each simulation. A sprout has high
sensitivity of VEGF and fibronectin concentrations. sVEGFR-1 always tries to
regress the sprout. When two or more sprouts come closer, they merge with each
other leading to anastomosis. Sufficient number of tip cells may cause sprout
towards tumor.

2005.13618,2020-08-11,"Monitoring fetal electroencephalogram intrapartum: a systematic
  literature review","  Background: Studies about the feasibility of monitoring fetal
electroencephalogram (fEEG) during labor began in the early 1940s. By the
1970s, clear diagnostic and prognostic benefits from intrapartum fEEG
monitoring were reported, but until today, this monitoring technology has
remained a curiosity.
  Objectives: Our goal was to review the studies reporting the use of fEEG
including the insights from interpreting fEEG patterns in response to uterine
contractions during labor. We also used the most relevant information gathered
from clinical studies to provide recommendations for enrollment in the unique
environment of a labor and delivery unit.
  Data sources: PubMed.
  Eligibility criteria: The search strategy was: (""fetus""[MeSH Terms] OR
""fetus""[All Fields] OR ""fetal""[All Fields]) AND (""electroencephalography""[MeSH
Terms] OR ""electroencephalography""[All Fields] OR ""eeg""[All Fields]) AND
(Clinical Trial[ptyp] AND ""humans""[MeSH Terms]). Because the landscape of fEEG
research has been international, we included studies in English, French,
German, and Russian.
  Results: From 256 screened studies, 40 studies were ultimately included in
the qualitative analysis. We summarize and report features of fEEG which
clearly show its potential to act as a direct biomarker of fetal brain health
during delivery, ancillary to fetal heart rate monitoring. However, clinical
prospective studies are needed to further establish the utility of fEEG
monitoring intrapartum. We identified clinical study designs likely to succeed
in bringing this intrapartum monitoring modality to the bedside.
  Limitations: Despite 80 years of studies in clinical cohorts and animal
models, the field of research on intrapartum fEEG is still nascent and shows
great promise to augment the currently practiced electronic fetal monitoring.

  for IVF","  A major challenge in clinical In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is selecting the
highest quality embryo to transfer to the patient in the hopes of achieving a
pregnancy. Time-lapse microscopy provides clinicians with a wealth of
information for selecting embryos. However, the resulting movies of embryos are
currently analyzed manually, which is time consuming and subjective. Here, we
automate feature extraction of time-lapse microscopy of human embryos with a
machine-learning pipeline of five convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our
pipeline consists of (1) semantic segmentation of the regions of the embryo,
(2) regression predictions of fragment severity, (3) classification of the
developmental stage, and object instance segmentation of (4) cells and (5)
pronuclei. Our approach greatly speeds up the measurement of quantitative,
biologically relevant features that may aid in embryo selection.

2006.00110,2020-06-02,A decade of movement ecology,"  Movement is fundamental to life, shaping population dynamics, biodiversity
patterns, and ecosystem structure. Recent advances in tracking technology have
enabled fundamental questions about movement to be tackled, leading to the
development of the movement ecology framework (MEF), considered a milestone in
the field [1]. The MEF introduced an integrative theory of organismal movement,
linking internal state, motion capacity and navigation capacity to external
factors. Here, a decade later, we investigated the current state of research in
the field. Using a text mining approach on >8000 peer-reviewed papers in
movement ecology, we explored the main research topics, evaluated the impact of
the MEF, and assessed changes in the use of technological devices, software and
statistical methods. The number of publications has increased considerably and
there have been major technological changes in the past decade (i.e.~increased
use of GPS devices, accelerometers and video cameras, and a convergence towards
R), yet we found that research focuses on the same questions, specifically, on
the effect of environmental factors on movement and behavior. In practice, it
appears that movement ecology research does not reflect the MEF. We call on
researchers to transform the field from technology-driven to embrace
interdisciplinary collaboration, in order to reveal key processes underlying
movement (e.g.~navigation), as well as evolutionary, physiological and
life-history consequences of particular strategies.

  hosts, and host-coronavirus interactions towards deep understanding of
  COVID-19","  Given the existing COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, it is critical to
systematically study the interactions between hosts and coronaviruses including
SARS-Cov, MERS-Cov, and SARS-CoV-2 (cause of COVID-19). We first created four
host-pathogen interaction (HPI)-Outcome postulates, and generated a HPI-Outcome
model as the basis for understanding host-coronavirus interactions (HCI) and
their relations with the disease outcomes. We hypothesized that ontology can be
used as an integrative platform to classify and analyze HCI and disease
outcomes. Accordingly, we annotated and categorized different coronaviruses,
hosts, and phenotypes using ontologies and identified their relations. Various
COVID-19 phenotypes are hypothesized to be caused by the backend HCI
mechanisms. To further identify the causal HCI-outcome relations, we collected
35 experimentally-verified HCI protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and applied
literature mining to identify additional host PPIs in response to coronavirus
infections. The results were formulated in a logical ontology representation
for integrative HCI-outcome understanding. Using known PPIs as baits, we also
developed and applied a domain-inferred prediction method to predict new PPIs
and identified their pathological targets on multiple organs. Overall, our
proposed ontology-based integrative framework combined with computational
predictions can be used to support fundamental understanding of the intricate
interactions between human patients and coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2)
and their association with various disease outcomes.

  efforts prompted by a health crisis: Scientometric comparisons across SARS,
  MERS and 2019-nCov literature","  During the current century, each major coronavirus outbreak has triggered a
quick surge of academic publications on this topic. The spike in research
publications following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19), however, has been
like no other. The global crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has mobilised
scientific efforts in an unprecedented way. In less than five months, more than
12,000 research items have been indexed while the number increasing every day.
With the crisis affecting all aspects of life, research on Covid-19 seems to
have become a focal point of interest across many academic disciplines. Here,
scientometric aspects of the Covid-19 literature are analysed and contrasted
with those of the two previous major Coronavirus diseases, i.e. SARS and MERS.
The focus is on the co-occurrence of key-terms, bibliographic coupling and
citation relations of journals and collaborations between countries. Certain
recurring patterns across all three literatures were discovered. All three
outbreaks have commonly generated three distinct and major cohort of studies:
(i) studies linked to the public health response and epidemic control, (ii)
studies associated with the chemical constitution of the virus and (iii)
studies related to treatment, vaccine and clinical care. While studies
affiliated with the category (i) seem to have been the first to emerge, they
overall received least numbers of citations compared to those of the two other
categories. Covid-19 studies seem to have been distributed across a broader
variety of journals and subject areas. Clear links are observed between the
geographical origins of each outbreak or the local geographical severity of
each outbreak and the magnitude of research originated from regions. Covid-19
studies also display the involvement of authors from a broader variety of
countries compared to SARS and MRS.

currently because these numbers inform decisions about how and when to lockdown
or reopen societies. We aim to provide a curated source for the key numbers
that help us understand the virus driving our current global crisis. This
compendium focuses solely on COVID-19 epidemiology. The numbers reported in
summary format are substantiated by annotated references. For each property, we
provide a concise definition, description of measurement and inference methods,
and associated caveats. We hope this compendium will make essential numbers
more accessible and avoid common sources of confusion for the many newcomers to
the field such as using the incubation period to denote and quantify the latent
period or using the hospitalization duration for the infectiousness period
duration. This document will be repeatedly updated and the community is invited
to participate in improving it.

2006.02232,2020-06-04,Analysis of Compression Techniques for DNA Sequence Data,"  Biological data mainly comprises of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and protein
sequences. These are the biomolecules which are present in all cells of human
beings. Due to the self-replicating property of DNA, it is a key constitute of
genetic material that exist in all breathingcreatures. This biomolecule (DNA)
comprehends the genetic material obligatory for the operational and expansion
of all personified lives. To save DNA data of single person we require
10CD-ROMs.Moreover, this size is increasing constantly, and more and more
sequences are adding in the public databases. This abundant increase in the
sequence data arise challenges in the precise information extraction from this
data. Since many data analyzing and visualization tools do not support
processing of this huge amount of data. To reduce the size of DNA and protein
sequence, many scientists introduced various types of sequence compression
algorithms such as compress or gzip, Context Tree Weighting (CTW), Lampel Ziv
Welch (LZW), arithmetic coding, run-length encoding and substitution method
etc. These techniques have sufficiently contributed to minimizing the volume of
the biological datasets. On the other hand, traditional compression techniques
are also not much suitable for the compression of these types of sequential
data. In this paper, we have explored diverse types of techniques for
compression of large amounts of DNA Sequence Data. In this paper, the analysis
of techniques reveals that efficient techniques not only reduce the size of the
sequence but also avoid any information loss. The review of existing studies
also shows that compression of a DNA sequence is significant for understanding
the critical characteristics of DNA data in addition to improving storage
efficiency and data transmission. In addition, the compression of the protein
sequence is a challenge for the research community. The major parameters for
evaluation of these compression algorithms include compression ratio, running
time complexity etc.

  Oncology Clinical Trials -- Application of the Estimand Framework","  COVID-19 outbreak has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic. The impact of
COVID-19 on patient journeys in oncology represents a new risk to
interpretation of trial results and its broad applicability for future clinical
practice. We identify key intercurrent events that may occur due to COVID-19 in
oncology clinical trials with a focus on time-to-event endpoints and discuss
considerations pertaining to the other estimand attributes introduced in the
ICH E9 addendum. We propose strategies to handle COVID-19 related intercurrent
events, depending on their relationship with malignancy and treatment and the
interpretability of data after them. We argue that the clinical trial objective
from a world without COVID-19 pandemic remains valid. The estimand framework
provides a common language to discuss the impact of COVID-19 in a structured
and transparent manner. This demonstrates that the applicability of the
framework may even go beyond what it was initially intended for.

reporting of clinical trial safety data may need to be modified, given the
potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact could include missed
visits, alternative methods for assessments (such as virtual visits),
alternative locations for assessments (such as local labs), and study drug
interruptions. We focus on safety planning for Phase 2-4 clinical trials and
integrated summaries for submissions. Starting from the recommended safety
analyses proposed in white papers and a workshop, created as part of an
FDA/PHUSE collaboration (PHUSE 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019), we assess what
modifications might be needed. Impact from COVID-19 will likely affect
treatment arms equally, so analyses of adverse events from controlled data can,
to a large extent, remain unchanged. However, interpretation of summaries from
uncontrolled data (summaries that include open-label extension data) will
require even more caution than usual. Special consideration will be needed for
safety topics of interest, especially events expected to have a higher
incidence due to a COVID-19 infection or due to quarantine or travel
restrictions (e.g., depression). Analyses of laboratory measurements may need
to be modified to account for the combination of measurements from local and
central laboratories.

2006.06429,2020-07-07,"Intermolecular Enzymatic Encoding of Nucleic Acid, Steroid Complexes: A
  New Theory on the Chemical Origin of Life Based on Evidence of Structural
  Symmetry","  The origin of life is one of the greatest mysteries. The mechanism for the
synthesis of DNA is synonymous with the chemical origin of life, and theories
have been developed along many lines of reasoning, but resolving all
requirements remains a challenge, such as defining an objective path to produce
sequences of encoded nucleotides paired as adenine to thymine and guanine to
cytosine. Here, a new theory for the origin of DNA is presented. The theory is
based upon three lines of experimental evidence and agreement of structural
symmetry between DNA nucleotides and steroid hormones, and introduces a new
concept of synthesizing both structural and functional characteristics of DNA
at the same time within a single unified complex of interleaved tetra-ringed
structures, steroid molecules which form reaction vessels that serve as
co-enzymatic building blocks. The new theory indicates that the establishment
of the DNA nucleotide code is among the very first synthesis steps. Moreover,
as a consequence of the intermolecular synthesis of both structural and
functional characteristics within a unified complex, there is a culminating
process step that sets forth in motion both DNA and the steroid structures that
subsequently trigger replication and transcription, as well as protein
translation, thereby resulting in the instantaneous release of life function.

leaf extracts from two plants were harvested in the Northern Algerian Sahara.
These are Cleome arabica (Capparaceae) and Pergularia tomentosa
(Asclepiadaceae). The efficacy of the extracts from the plants was evaluated by
the reflux extraction method. The phytochemical screening of the aqueous
extracts of C. arabica shows a remarkable richness in active principles in
comparison with the extract of P. tomentosa; including flavonoids, saponosides,
glycosides, terpenes, sterols, deoxyose, polyphenols and total alkaloids. The
imago of Tribolium confusum treated with aqueous extracts of C. arabica and P.
tomentosa at doses of 80% to 100% respectively have mortality rates of 73.33%
to 96.67%, and 36.67% to 86.67%. The lethal time 50 (TL50%) of the aqueous
extract of C. arabica was estimated about 6.41 days, and 6.94 days for the
extract P. tomentosa for the imago of T. confusum. The extracts of P. tomentosa
is less toxic than the extracts of C. arabica. The allelopathic potentials of
C. arabica and P. tomentosa tested on germination of the seeds of a weed
Dactyloctenium aegyptium (Poaceae) and two cultivated species, including
Hordeumvulgare and Triticumdurum (Poaceae), show that the inhibitory effect of
extracts of C. arabica is very highly significant. It manifests itself in the
growth of the aerial and underground part of the H. vulgar and T. durum. The
inhibition rate is more than 84.44% for D. aegyptium seeds treated with the
different concentrations. The inhibition rates range from 75.56% to 91.11% for

2006.08647,2020-06-17,"Universal Relation for Life-span Energy Consumption in Living Organisms:
  Insights for the origin of ageing","  Metabolic energy consumption has long been thought to play a major role in
the aging process ({\it 1}). Across species, a gram of tissue on average
expends about the same amount of energy during life-span ({\it 2}). Energy
restriction has also been shown that increases maximum life-span ({\it 3}) and
retards age-associated changes ({\it 4}). However, there are significant
exceptions to a universal energy consumption during life-span, mainly coming
from the inter-class comparison ({\it 5, 6}). Here we present a unique relation
for life-span energy consumption, valid for $\sim$300 species representing all
classes of living organisms, from unicellular ones to the largest mammals. The
relation has an average scatter of only 0.3 dex, with 95\% ($\rm 2-\sigma$) of
the organisms having departures less than a factor of $\pi$ from the relation,
despite the $\sim$20 orders of magnitude difference in body mass, reducing any
possible inter-class variation in the relation to only a geometrical factor.
This result can be interpreted as supporting evidence for the existence of an
approximately constant total number $\rm N_r \sim 10^8$ of respiration cycles
per lifetime for all organisms, effectively predetermining the extension of
life by the basic energetics of respiration, being an incentive for future
studies that investigate the relation of such constant $\rm N_r$ cycles per
lifetime with the production rates of free radicals and oxidants, which may
give definite constraints on the origin of ageing.

2006.08823,2020-06-17,"Not even the air of empty spaces is coronavirus free (Two meters is not
  a safe distance)","  A key safety measure encouraged by health authorities to avoid the SARS-CoV-2
spreading is the distance of one to two meters between people. This recommended
two-meters distance is mainly based on short-distance contagion, when infected
drops are expelled during a speech, coughing, or sneezing and directly hit
another person. The dangerous form of airway contamination caused by droplets
that remain suspended in the air for several hours has been almost ignored.
However, the theoretical calculations performed in this work, recent
experiments, and the accumulated knowledge in this and other epidemics indicate
that, because of the airborne transmission, there is no safe distance to the
coronavirus, either indoors or in open places. Recent investigations have
confirmed not only the presence of the coronavirus in droplets suspended in the
air but that these viruses remain active for several hours. Furthermore,
significant indirect evidence of this means of transmission is the great
difference in contagion between Brazilian regions in the current outbreak.
While the Amazonian states have a contamination rate greater than 20%, in the
southern states of the country this rate is less than 1%, despite high
temperatures in the Northern region. Notwithstanding the social and economic
differences between these regions, it seems that the extremely high humidity of
the forest air prolongs the survival of the viruses in the drops in the
external environment. Our theoretical calculations explain empirical
observations from recent epidemiological studies and strengthen the need to
use, not only a mask but also protective glasses throughout the population in
the same way that they are mandatory for health professionals. Besides, our
calculations show how air conditioning and heating systems can increase
contagion. Finally, we suggest measures that could reduce the spread of the
pandemic.

2006.08867,2022-09-28,"Optimisation of non-pharmaceutical measures in COVID-19 growth via
  neural networks","  On 19th March, the World Health Organisation declared a pandemic. Through
this global spread, many nations have witnessed exponential growth of confirmed
cases brought under control by severe mass quarantine or lockdown measures.
However, some have, through a different timeline of actions, prevented this
exponential growth. Currently as some continue to tackle growth, others attempt
to safely lift restrictions whilst avoiding a resurgence. This study seeks to
quantify the impact of government actions in mitigating viral transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 by a novel soft computing approach that makes concurrent use of a
neural network model, to predict the daily slope increase of cumulative
infected, and an optimiser, with a parametrisation of the government
restriction time series, to understanding the best set of mitigating actions.
Data for two territories, Italy and Taiwan, have been gathered to model
government restrictions in traveling, testing and enforcement of social
distance measures as well as people connectivity and adherence to government
actions. It is found that a larger and earlier testing campaign with tighter
entry restrictions benefit both regions, resulting in significantly less
confirmed cases. Interestingly, this scenario couples with an earlier but
milder implementation of nationwide restrictions for Italy, thus supporting
Taiwan's lack of nationwide lockdown. The results, found with a purely
data-driven approach, are in line with the main findings of mathematical
epidemiological models, proving that the proposed approach has value and that
the data alone contains valuable knowledge to inform decision makers.

2006.13012,2020-08-17,Key Questions for Modelling COVID-19 Exit Strategies,"  Combinations of intense non-pharmaceutical interventions ('lockdowns') were
introduced in countries worldwide to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Many
governments have begun to implement lockdown exit strategies that allow
restrictions to be relaxed while attempting to control the risk of a surge in
cases. Mathematical modelling has played a central role in guiding
interventions, but the challenge of designing optimal exit strategies in the
face of ongoing transmission is unprecedented. Here, we report discussions from
the Isaac Newton Institute 'Models for an exit strategy' workshop (11-15 May
2020). A diverse community of modellers who are providing evidence to
governments worldwide were asked to identify the main questions that, if
answered, will allow for more accurate predictions of the effects of different
exit strategies. Based on these questions, we propose a roadmap to facilitate
the development of reliable models to guide exit strategies. The roadmap
requires a global collaborative effort from the scientific community and
policy-makers, and is made up of three parts: i) improve estimation of key
epidemiological parameters; ii) understand sources of heterogeneity in
populations; iii) focus on requirements for data collection, particularly in
Low-to-Middle-Income countries. This will provide important information for
planning exit strategies that balance socio-economic benefits with public
health.

2007.02580,2020-09-01,"Forcing Seasonality of influenza-like epidemics with daily Solar
  resonance","  Seasonality of acute viral respiratory diseases is a well-known and yet not
fully understood phenomenon. Several models have been proposed to explain the
regularity of yearly recurring outbreaks and the phase-differences observed at
different latitudes on Earth. Such models take into account known internal
causes, primarily the periodic emergence of new virus variants that evade the
host immune response. Yet, this alone, is generally unable to explain the
regularity of recurrences and the observed phase-differences. Here we show that
seasonality of viral respiratory diseases, as well as its distribution with
latitude on Earth, can be fully explained by the virucidal properties of UV-B
and A Solar photons through a daily, minute-scale, resonant forcing mechanism.
Such an induced periodicity can last, virtually unperturbed, from tens to
hundreds of cycles, and even in presence of internal dynamics (host's loss of
immunity) much slower than seasonal will, on a long period, generate seasonal
oscillations.

2007.05362,2020-07-13,Quantitative clarification of key questions about COVID-19 epidemiology,"  Modeling the spread of COVID-19 is crucial for informing public health
policy. All models for COVID-19 epidemiology rely on parameters describing the
dynamics of the infection process. The meanings of epidemiological parameters
like R_0, R_t, the ""serial interval"" and ""generation interval"" can be
challenging to understand, especially as these and other parameters are
conceptually overlapping and sometimes confusingly named. Moreover, the
procedures used to estimate these parameters make various assumptions and use
different mathematical approaches that should be understood and accounted for
when relying on parameter values and reporting them to the public. Here, we
offer several insights regarding the derivation of commonly-reported
epidemiological parameters, and describe how mitigation measures like lockdown
are expected to affect their values. We aim to present these quantitative
relationships in a manner that is accessible to the widest audience possible.
We hope that better communicating the intricacies of epidemiological models
will improve our collective understanding of their strengths and weaknesses,
and will help avoid possible pitfalls when using them.

2007.05410,2020-10-07,A Physics Modeling Study of SARS-CoV-2 Transport in Air,"  The health threat from SARS-CoV-2 airborne infection has become a public
emergency of international concern. During the ongoing coronavirus pandemic,
people have been advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to
maintain social distancing of at least 2 m to limit the risk of exposure to the
coronavirus. Experimental data, however, show that infected aerosols and
droplets trapped inside a turbulent puff cloud can travel up to 7 to 8 m. We
propose a nuclear physics analogy-based modeling of the complex gas cloud and
its payload of pathogen-virions. We show that the cloud stopping range is
proportional to the product of the puff's diameter and its density. We use our
puff model to determine the average density of the buoyant fluid in the
turbulent cloud. A fit to the experimental data yields $1.8 < \rho_P/\rho_{\rm
air} < 4.0$, where $\rho_P$ and $\rho_{\rm air}$ are the average density of the
puff and the air. We demonstrate that temperature variation could cause an
${\cal O}(\pm 8\%)$ effect in the puff stopping range for extreme ambient cold
or warmth. We also demonstrate that aerosols and droplets can remain suspended
for hours in the air. Therefore, once the puff slows down sufficiently, and its
coherence is lost, the eventual spreading of the infected aerosols becomes
dependent on the ambient air currents and turbulence.

  coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2: Detection, comparison and implications
  for therapeutic targeting","  The genomic ssRNA of coronaviruses is packaged within a helical nucleocapsid.
Due to transitional symmetry of a helix, weakly specific cooperative
interaction between ssRNA and nucleocapsid proteins leads to the natural
selection of specific quasi-periodic assembly/packaging signals in the related
genomic sequence. Such signals coordinated with the nucleocapsid helical
structure were detected and reconstructed in the genomes of the coronaviruses
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The main period of the signals for both viruses was
about 54 nt, that implies 6.75 nt per N protein. The complete coverage of ssRNA
genome of length about 30,000 nt by the nucleocapsid would need 4,400 N
proteins, that makes them the most abundant among the structural proteins. The
repertoires of motifs for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were divergent but nearly
coincided for different isolates of SARS-CoV-2. We obtained the distributions
of assembly/packaging signals over the genomes with non-overlapping windows of
width 432 nt. Finally, using the spectral entropy, we compared the load from
point mutations and indels during virus age for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We
found the higher mutational load on SARS-CoV. In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 can be
treated as a ""newborn"" virus. These observations may be helpful in practical
medical applications and are of basic interest.

2007.10823,2020-07-22,"Can animal manure be used to increase soil organic carbon stocks in the
  Mediterranean as a mitigation climate change strategy?","  Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role on improving soil
conditions and soil functions. Increasing land use changes have induced an
important decline of SOC content at global scale. Increasing SOC in
agricultural soils has been proposed as a strategy to mitigate climate change.
Animal manure has the characteristic of enriching SOC, when applied to crop
fields, while, in parallel, it could constitute a natural fertilizer for the
crops. In this paper, a simulation is performed using the area of Catalonia,
Spain as a case study for the characteristic low SOC in the Mediterranean, to
examine whether animal manure can improve substantially the SOC of agricultural
fields, when applied as organic fertilizers. Our results show that the policy
goals of the 4x1000 strategy can be achieved only partially by using manure
transported to the fields. This implies that the proposed approach needs to be
combined with other strategies.

  Practitioners in Taiwan: A Pilot SF-36 Survey","  Objective: Falun Gong (FLG) is a practice of mind and body focusing on moral
character improvement along with meditative exercises. This 2002 pilot study
explored perceived health status, medical resource utilization and related
factors among Taiwanese FLG practitioners, compared to the general Taiwanese
norm estimated by the 2001 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Methods:
This cross-sectional, observational study was based on a voluntary, paper-based
survey conducted from October 2002 to February 2003 using the same Taiwanese
SF-36 instrument employed by the NHIS. Primary outcomes included eight SF-36
domain scores and the number of medical visits. One-sample t-tests, one-way
ANOVA and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed. Results: The
response rate was 75.6% (1,210/1,600). Compared to the norm, the study cohort
had significantly higher scores in six of eight SF-36 domains across gender and
age (p<0.05). Among those with chronic diseases, 70% to 89% reported their
conditions either improved or cured. 74.2%, 79.2%, 83.3%, and 85.6% quitted
alcohol drinking, smoking, chewing betel nuts, and gambling. 62.7% reported a
reduced number of medical visits (mean=13.53 before; mean=5.87 after).
Conclusions: In this subject cohort, practicing FLG led to higher perceived
health scores and reduced health resource utilization compared to the norm.

2007.15117,2020-08-12,Phenotypic variability in Italian rice germplasm,"  Plant breeding is one of the key strategies for further enhancement of crop
yields; however, effective breeding strategies require phenotypic
characterisation of the available germplasm. This study sought to characterise
the phenotypic expression of fourteen crop traits related to phenology, plant
architecture, and yield in a panel of 40 cultivars selected to represent the
phenotypic variability present in Italian rice germplasm during a two-season
field experiment. The observed range of phenotypic variation was high for many
traits (coefficients of variation ranging from 5.9\% to 45.4\%) including yield
(mean: 6.47 t ha\textsuperscript{-1}; CV: 15.4\%; min: 2.19 t
ha\textsuperscript{-1}; max: 8.95 t ha\textsuperscript{-1}), and multiple
strong associations emerged in all the analysed traits. Cluster analysis
extracted three groups of genotypes characterised by alternative yield
strategies, i.e. ""high-tillering"", ""early maturing"", and ""increased
source-sink"". Our findings highlight that rice yield decrease when one strategy
is overemphasised. In contrast, the highest-yielding genotypes have a balanced
ratio between sink and source organs, along with a proportional duration of
vegetative and reproductive phases. This study depicts the phenotypic
variability in Italian rice cultivars and proposes a novel classification based
on yield-related traits which could be of use in multiple rice breeding
applications.

  and disease","  Human skin is a region of high metabolic activity where a rich variety of
biomarkers are secreted from the stratum corneum. The skin is a constant source
of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) derived from skin glands and resident
microbiota. Skin VOCs contain the footprints of cellular activities and thus
offer unique insights into the intricate processes of cutaneous physiology.
This review examines the growing body of research on skin VOC markers as they
relate to skin physiology, whereby variations in skin-intrinsic and microbial
metabolic processes give rise to unique volatile profiles. Emerging evidence
for volatile biomarkers linked to skin perturbations and skin cancer are
examined. Microbial-derived VOCs are also investigated as prospective
diagnostic markers, and their potential to shape the composition of the local
skin microbiota, and consequently cutaneous health, is considered. Finally, a
brief outlook on emerging analytical challenges and opportunities for skin
VOC-based research and diagnostics is presented.

2008.02241,2020-08-06,Ontology-based annotation and analysis of COVID-19 phenotypes,"  The epidemic of COVID-19 has caused an unpredictable and devastated disaster
to the public health in different territories around the world. Common
phenotypes include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and chills. With more
cases investigated, other clinical phenotypes are gradually recognized, for
example, loss of smell, and loss of tastes. Compared with discharged or cured
patients, severe or died patients often have one or more comorbidities, such as
hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. In this study, we
systematically collected and analyzed COVID-19-related clinical phenotypes from
70 articles. The commonly occurring 17 phenotypes were classified into
different groups based on the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). Based on the HP
classification, we systematically analyze three nervous phenotypes (loss of
smell, loss of taste, and headache) and four abdominal phenotypes (nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea) identified in patients, and found that
patients from Europe and USA turned to have higher nervous phenotypes and
abdominal phenotypes than patients from Asia. A total of 23 comorbidities were
found to commonly exist among COVID-19 patients. Patients with these
comorbidities such as diabetes and kidney failure had worse outcomes compared
with those without these comorbidities.

2008.08668,2020-08-21,"Self-Organized Networks with Long-Range Interactions: Tandem Darwinian
  Evolution of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Tubulin","  Cytoskeletons are self-organized networks based on polymerized proteins:
actin, tubulin, and driven by motor proteins, such as myosin, kinesin and
dynein. Their positive Darwinian evolution enables them to approach optimized
functionality (self-organized criticality). Our theoretical analysis uses
hydropathic waves to identify and contrast the functional differences between
the polymerizing $\alpha$ and $\beta$ tubulin monomers, which are similar in
length and secondary structures, as well as having indistinguishable
phylogenetic trees. We show how evolution has improved water-driven flexibility
especially for $\alpha$ tubulin, and thus facilitated heterodimer microtubule
assembly, in agreement with recent atomistic simulations and topological
models. We conclude that the failure of phylogenetic analysis to identify
functionally specific positive Darwinian evolution has been caused by 20th
century technical limitations. These are overcome using 21st century
quantitative mathematical methods based on thermodynamic scaling and
hydropathic modular averaging. Our most surprising result is the identification
of large level sets, especially in hydrophobic extrema, with both
thermodynamically first- and second-order scaled water waves. Our calculations
include explicitly long-range water-protein interactions described by fractals.
We also suggest a much-needed corrective for large protein drug development
costs.

2008.08814,2022-03-10,An RNA-Based Theory of Natural Universal Computation,"  Life is confronted with computation problems in a variety of domains
including animal behavior, single-cell behavior, and embryonic development. Yet
we currently do not know of a naturally existing biological system that is
capable of universal computation, i.e., Turing-equivalent in scope. Generic
finite-dimensional dynamical systems (which encompass most models of neural
networks, intracellular signaling cascades, and gene regulatory networks) fall
short of universal computation, but are assumed to be capable of explaining
cognition and development. I present a class of models that bridge two concepts
from distant fields: combinatory logic (or, equivalently, lambda calculus) and
RNA molecular biology. A set of basic RNA editing rules can make it possible to
compute any computable function with identical algorithmic complexity to that
of Turing machines. The models do not assume extraordinarily complex molecular
machinery or any processes that radically differ from what we already know to
occur in cells. Distinct independent enzymes can mediate each of the rules and
RNA molecules solve the problem of parenthesis matching through their secondary
structure. In the most plausible of these models all of the editing rules can
be implemented with merely cleavage and ligation operations at fixed positions
relative to predefined motifs. This demonstrates that universal computation is
well within the reach of molecular biology. It is therefore reasonable to
assume that life has evolved - or possibly began with - a universal computer
that yet remains to be discovered. The variety of seemingly unrelated
computational problems across many scales can potentially be solved using the
same RNA-based computation system. Experimental validation of this theory may
immensely impact our understanding of memory, cognition, development, disease,
evolution, and the early stages of life.

  the ""Topological shape of ageing""","  Living systems are subject to the arrow of time; from birth, they undergo
complex transformations (self-organization) in a constant battle for survival,
but inevitably ageing and disease trap them to death. Can ageing be understood
and eventually reversed? What tools can be employed to further our
understanding of ageing? The present article is an invitation for biologists
and clinicians to consider key conceptual ideas and computational tools (known
to mathematicians and physicists), which potentially may help dissect some of
the underlying processes of ageing and disease. Specifically, we first discuss
how to classify and analyze complex systems, as well as highlight critical
theoretical difficulties that make complex systems hard to study. Subsequently,
we introduce Topological Data Analysis - a novel Big Data tool - which may help
in the study of complex systems since it extracts knowledge from data in a
holistic approach via topological considerations. These conceptual ideas and
tools are discussed in a rather informal way to pave future discussions and
collaborations between mathematicians and biologists studying ageing.

  COVID-19","  The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported in
December 2019 and the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was declared a pandemic in March
2020 by the World Health Organization. This sparked a plethora of
investigations into diagnostics and vaccination for SARS-CoV-2, as well as
treatments for COVID-19. Since COVID-19 is a severe disease associated with a
high mortality, clinical trials in this disease should be monitored by a data
monitoring committee (DMC), also known as data safety monitoring board (DSMB).
DMCs in this indication face a number of challenges including fast recruitment
requiring an unusually high frequency of safety reviews, more frequent use of
complex designs and virtually no prior experience with the disease. In this
paper, we provide a perspective on the work of DMCs for clinical trials of
treatments for COVID-19. More specifically, we discuss organizational aspects
of setting up and running DMCs for COVID-19 trials, in particular for trials
with more complex designs such as platform trials or adaptive designs.
Furthermore, statistical aspects of monitoring clinical trials of treatments
for COVID-19 are considered. Some recommendations are made regarding the
presentation of the data, stopping rules for safety monitoring and the use of
external data. The proposed stopping boundaries are assessed in a simulation

procedures. Thus, this study aims to assess the mechanisms of dental aerosol
dispersion in dental offices and to provide recommendations based on a
quantitative study to minimize infection transmission in dental offices. The
spread and removal of aerosol particles generated from dental procedures in a
dental office are measured near the source and at the corner of the office. We
studied the effects of air purification (on/off), door condition (open/close),
and particle sizes on the temporal concentration distribution of particles. The
results show that in the worst-scenario scenario it takes 95 min for 0.5 um
particles to settle, and that it takes a shorter time for the larger particles.
The indoor air purifier tested expedited the removal time at least 6.3 times
faster than the scenario air purifier off. Airborne particles may be
transported from the source to the rest of the room, even when the particle
concentrations in the generation zone return to the background level. These
results are expected to be valuable to related policy making and technology
development for infection disease control in dental offices and similar built
environments.

  CoV-1 and CoV-2","  CoV2019 has evolved to be much more dangerous than CoV2003. Experiments
suggest that structural rearrangements dramatically enhance CoV2019 activity.
We identify a new first stage of infection which precedes structural
rearrangements by using biomolecular evolutionary theory to identify sequence
differences enhancing viral attachment rates. We find a small cluster of
mutations which show that CoV-2 has a new feature that promotes much stronger
viral attachment and enhances contagiousness. The extremely dangerous dynamics
of human coronavirus infection is a dramatic example of evolutionary approach
of self-organized networks to criticality. It may favor a very successful
vaccine. The identified mutations can be used to test the present theory
experimentally.

2008.12984,2020-09-01,Darwinian Evolution of Taste,"  What is life. Schrodingers question is discussed here for a specific protein,
villin, which builds cells in tissues that detect taste and sound. Villin is
represented by a sequence of 827 amino acids bound to a peptide backbone chain.
We focus attention on a limited problem, the Darwinian evolution of villin
sequences from chickens to humans. This biophysical problem is analyzed using a
new physicical method based on thermodynamic domain scaling, a technique that
bridges the gap between physical concepts, self-organized criticality, and
conventional biostructural practice. It turns out that the evolutionary changes
can be explained by Darwinian selection, which is not generally accepted by
biologists at the protein level. The presentation is self-contained, and
requires no prior experience with proteins at the molecular level.

2009.06307,2023-09-08,Ranking influential nodes in networks from partial information,"  Many complex systems exhibit a natural hierarchy in which elements can be
ranked according to a notion of ""influence"". While the complete and accurate
knowledge of the interactions between constituents is ordinarily required for
the computation of nodes' influence, using a low-rank approximation we show
that in a variety of contexts local information about the neighborhoods of
nodes is enough to reliably estimate how influential they are, without the need
to infer or reconstruct the whole map of interactions. Our framework is
successful in approximating with high accuracy different incarnations of
influence in systems as diverse as the WWW PageRank, trophic levels of
ecosystems, upstreamness of industrial sectors in complex economies, and
centrality measures of social networks, as long as the underlying network is
not exceedingly sparse. We also discuss the implications of this ""emerging
locality"" on the approximate calculation of non-linear network observables.

2009.06499,2021-07-26,Phosphine on Venus Cannot be Explained by Conventional Processes,"  The recent candidate detection of ~1 ppb of phosphine in the middle
atmosphere of Venus is so unexpected that it requires an exhaustive search for
explanations of its origin. Phosphorus-containing species have not been
modelled for Venus' atmosphere before and our work represents the first attempt
to model phosphorus species in the Venusian atmosphere. We thoroughly explore
the potential pathways of formation of phosphine in a Venusian environment,
including in the planet's atmosphere, cloud and haze layers, surface, and
subsurface. We investigate gas reactions, geochemical reactions,
photochemistry, and other non-equilibrium processes. None of these potential
phosphine production pathways are sufficient to explain the presence of ppb
phosphine levels on Venus. If PH3's presence in Venus' atmosphere is confirmed,
it therefore is highly likely to be the result of a process not previously
considered plausible for Venusian conditions. The process could be unknown
geochemistry, photochemistry, or even aerial microbial life, given that on
Earth phosphine is exclusively associated with anthropogenic and biological
sources. The detection of phosphine adds to the complexity of chemical
processes in the Venusian environment and motivates in situ follow up sampling
missions to Venus. Our analysis provides a template for investigation of
phosphine as a biosignature on other worlds.

2009.09702,2022-04-25,On the verge of life: Distribution of nucleotide sequences in viral RNAs,"  The aim of the study is to analyze viruses using parameters obtained from
distributions of nucleotide sequences in the viral RNA. Seeking for the input
data homogeneity, we analyze single-stranded RNA viruses only. Two approaches
are used to obtain the nucleotide sequences; In the first one, chunks of equal
length (four nucleotides) are considered. In the second approach, the whole RNA
genome is divided into parts by adenine or the most frequent nucleotide as a
""space"". Rank--frequency distributions are studied in both cases. Within the
first approach, the P\'olya and the negative hypergeometric distribution yield
the best fit. For the distributions obtained within the second approach, we
have calculated a set of parameters, including entropy, mean sequence length,
and its dispersion. The calculated parameters became the basis for the
classification of viruses. We observed that proximity of viruses on planes
spanned on various pairs of parameters corresponds to related species. In
certain cases, such a proximity is observed for unrelated species as well
calling thus for the expansion of the set of parameters used in the
classification. We also observed that the fourth most frequent nucleotide
sequences obtained within the second approach are of different nature in case
of human coronaviruses (different nucleotides for MERS, SARS-CoV, and
SARS-CoV-2 versus identical nucleotides for four other coronaviruses). We
expect that our findings will be useful as a supplementary tool in the
classification of diseases caused by RNA viruses with respect to severity and
contagiousness.

  markets?","  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus caused the
novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) affecting the whole world. Like
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 are thought to originate in bats and then
spread to humans through intermediate hosts. Identifying intermediate host
species is critical to understanding the evolution and transmission mechanisms
of COVID-19. However, determining which animals are intermediate hosts remains
a key challenge. Virus host-genome similarity (HGS) is an important factor that
reflects the adaptability of virus to host. SARS-CoV-2 may retain beneficial
mutations to increase HGS and evade the host immune system. This study
investigated the HGSs between 399 SARS-CoV-2 strains and 10 hosts of different
species, including bat, mouse, cat, swine, snake, dog, pangolin, chicken, human
and monkey. The results showed that the HGS between SARS-CoV-2 and bat was the
highest, followed by mouse and cat. Human and monkey had the lowest HGS values.
In terms of genetic similarity, mouse and monkey are halfway between bat and
human. Moreover, given that COVID-19 outbreaks tend to be associated with live
poultry and seafood markets, mouse and cat are more likely sources of infection
in these places. However, more experimental data are needed to confirm whether
mouse and cat are true intermediate hosts. These findings suggest that animals
closely related to human life, especially those with high HGS, need to be
closely monitored.

doctors began treating patients with blood plasma donated by recovered (or
convalesced) survivors. Passive immunity transfer via administration of
convalesced blood product (CBP) appears to represent a readily available and
promising avenue for mitigating mortalities, expediting recovery time, and even
prophylaxis against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here, we review challenges to CBP
efficacy, and present a graph theoretical model of transmission dynamics that
identifies evolving hubs of COVID-19 cases. Importantly, this model suggests
that CBP efficacy may rest on an efficient and distributed global sampling
scheme as opposed to CBP pooled from local donors alone.

sequence and by their size. Here, we argue that if our main aim is to
understand the effect of mutations on evolutionary outcomes (such as adaptation
or speciation), we need to instead consider their population genetic and
genomic effects, from altering recombination rate to modifying chromatin. We
start by reviewing known population genetic and genomic effects of different
mutation types and connect these to the major evolutionary processes of drift
and selection. We illustrate how mutation type can thus be linked with
evolutionary outcomes and provide suggestions for further exploring and
quantifying these relationships. This reframing lays a foundation for
determining the evolutionary significance of different mutation types.

facilitates discussions to ensure alignment between the key question of
interest, the analysis, and interpretation. Therapeutic knowledge and drug
mechanism play a crucial role in determining the strategy and defining the
estimand for clinical trial designs. Clinical trials in patients with
hematological malignancies often present unique challenges for trial design due
to complexity of treatment options and existence of potential curative but
highly risky procedures, e.g. stem cell transplant or treatment sequence across
different phases (induction, consolidation, maintenance). Here, we illustrate
how to apply the estimand framework in hematological clinical trials and how
the estimand framework can address potential difficulties in trial result
interpretation.
  This paper is a result of a cross-industry collaboration to connect the
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E9 addendum concepts to
applications. Three randomized phase 3 trials will be used to consider common
challenges including intercurrent events in hematologic oncology trials to
illustrate different scientific questions and the consequences of the estimand
choice for trial design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation.
Template language for describing estimand in both study protocols and

hyperinflammatory condition, the state more often leads to admission to
intensive care unit with rapid mortality. Janus kinase enzymes of Jak-1, Jak-2,
Jak-3, and Tyk2 seem to be good targets for inhibition by medications to
control cytokine storm in this context. In the present work, the inhibitory
properties of different analgesic drugs on these targets are studied to assess
their ability for clinical application from different points of view. Our
docking results indicated that naproxen, methadone, and amitriptyline
considering their higher binding energy, lower energy variance, and higher
hydrophobicity, seem to express more inhibitory effects on Janus kinase enzymes
than thats for approved inhibitors i.e. baricitinib and ruxolitinib.
Accordingly, we suggest our wide list of candidate drugs including
indomethacin, etodolac, buprenorphine, rofecoxib, duloxetine, valdecoxib,

COVID-19 pandemic, showing how viruses can quickly spread and how they can
impact society as a whole. Novel techniques that bring in different disciplines
must emerge to provide forward-looking strategies to combat viral infections,
as well as possible future pandemics. In the past decade, an interdisciplinary
area involving bioengineering, nanotechnology and information and communication
technology (ICT) has been developing, known as Molecular Communications. This
new emerging area uses elements of classical communication systems and maps it
to molecular signalling and communication found inside and outside the body,
where the aim is to develop new tools that can serve future medicine. In this
paper, we provide an extensive and detailed discussion on how Molecular
Communications can be integrated into the research on viral infectious diseases
modelling, and how possible treatment and vaccines can be developed considering
molecules as information carriers. We provide a literature review on the
existing models of Molecular Communications for viral infection (in-body and
out-body), a deep analysis on their effects on the host and subsequent
communication process for other systems within the body (e.g., immune
response), sources of experimental data on known viral infections and how it
can be used by the Molecular Communications community, as well as open issues

  for DNA Classification","  The classification of DNA sequences is a key research area in bioinformatics
as it enables researchers to conduct genomic analysis and detect possible
diseases. In this paper, three state-of-the-art algorithms, namely
Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, and N-gram Probabilistic
Models, are used for the task of DNA classification. Furthermore, we introduce
a novel feature extraction method based on the Levenshtein distance and
randomly generated DNA sub-sequences to compute information-rich features from
the DNA sequences. We also use an existing feature extraction method based on
3-grams to represent amino acids and combine both feature extraction methods
with a multitude of machine learning algorithms. Four different data sets, each
concerning viral diseases such as Covid-19, AIDS, Influenza, and Hepatitis C,
are used for evaluating the different approaches. The results of the
experiments show that all methods obtain high accuracies on the different DNA
datasets. Furthermore, the domain-specific 3-gram feature extraction method
leads in general to the best results in the experiments, while the newly
proposed technique outperforms all other methods on the smallest Covid-19
dataset

2011.00884,2022-09-07,"Mobile Human Ad Hoc Networks: A Communication Engineering Viewpoint on
  Interhuman Airborne Pathogen Transmission","  A number of transmission models for airborne pathogens transmission, as
required to understand airborne infectious diseases such as COVID-19, have been
proposed independently from each other, at different scales, and by researchers
from various disciplines. We propose a communication engineering approach that
blends different disciplines such as epidemiology, biology, medicine, and fluid
dynamics. The aim is to present a unified framework using communication
engineering, and to highlight future research directions for modeling the
spread of infectious diseases through airborne transmission. We introduce the
concept of mobile human ad hoc networks (MoHANETs), which exploits the
similarity of airborne transmission-driven human groups with mobile ad hoc
networks and uses molecular communication as the enabling paradigm. In the
MoHANET architecture, a layered structure is employed where the infectious
human emitting pathogen-laden droplets and the exposed human to these droplets
are considered as the transmitter and receiver, respectively. Our
proof-of-concept results, which we validated using empirical COVID-19 data,
clearly demonstrate the ability of our MoHANET architecture to predict the
dynamics of infectious diseases by considering the propagation of
pathogen-laden droplets, their reception and mobility of humans.

2011.01873,2020-11-04,Self-Organized Networks: Darwinian Evolution of Myosin-1,"  Cytoskeletons are self-organized networks based on polymerized proteins:
actin, tubulin, and driven by motor proteins, such as myosin, kinesin and
dynein. Their positive Darwinian evolution enables them to approach optimized
functionality (self-organized criticality). The principal features of the
eukaryotic evolution of the cytoskeleton motor protein myosin-1 parallel those
of actin and tubulin, but also show striking differences connected to its
dynamical function. Optimized (long) hydropathic waves characterize the
molecular level Darwinian evolution towards optimized functionality
(self-organized criticality). The N-terminal and central domains of myosin-1
have evolved in eukaryotes at different rates, with the central domain
hydropathic extrema being optimally active in humans. A test shows that
hydropathic scaling can yield accuracies of better than 1% near optimized
functionality. Evolution towards synchronized level extrema is connected to a
special function of Mys-1 in humans involving Golgi complexes.

  Blood Pressure in Viral/Bacterial Disease Onsets with Signal Dynamics","  Signal-based early detection of illnesses has been a key topic in research
and hospital settings; it reduces technological costs and paves the way for
quick and effective patient-care operations. Elementary machine learning and
signal processing algorithms have proven to be sufficient in classifying the
onset of viral and bacterial conditions before clinical symptoms are shown.
Inspired by these recent developments, this project employs signal dynamics
analysis to infer changes in vital signs (temperature, respiration, and heart
rate). The results demonstrate that the trends of one vital function can be
predicted from that of another. In particular, it is shown that heart rate and
respiration typically change shortly after body temperature, and aortic blood
pressure follows. This is not an etiologically specific approach, but if
advanced further, it can enable patients and wearable system users to tame
these changes and prevent immediate symptoms.

2011.04202,2020-11-17,Clinical Landscape of COVID-19 Testing: Difficult Choices,"  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread rapidly across
the world, leading to enormous amounts of human death and economic loss. Until
definitive preventive or curative measures are developed, policies regarding
testing, contact tracing, and quarantine remain the best public health tools
for curbing viral spread. Testing is a crucial component of these efforts,
enabling the identification and isolation of infected individuals. Differences
in testing methodologies, time frames, and outcomes can have an impact on their
overall efficiency, usability and efficacy. In this early draft, we draw a
comparison between the various types of diagnostic tests including PCR,
antigen, and home tests in relation to their relative advantages,
disadvantages, and use cases. We also look into alternative and unconventional
methods. Further, we analyze the short-term and long-term impacts of the virus
and its testing on various verticals such as business, government laws,
policies, and healthcare.

2011.04636,2022-02-02,"Low-Order Nonlinear Animal Model of Glucose Dynamics for a Bihormonal
  Intraperitoneal Artificial Pancreas","  Objective: The design of an Artificial Pancreas (AP) to regulate blood
glucose levels requires reliable control methods. Model Predictive Control has
emerged as a promising approach for glycemia control. However, model--based
control methods require computationally simple and identifiable mathematical
models that represent glucose dynamics accurately, which is challenging due to
the complexity of glucose homeostasis. Methods: In this work, a simple model is
deduced to estimate blood glucose concentration in subjects with Type 1
Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Novel features in the model are power--law kinetics
for intraperitoneal insulin absorption and a separate glucagon sensitivity
state. Profile likelihood and a method based on singular value decomposition of
the sensitivity matrix are carried out to assess parameter identifiability and
guide a model reduction for improving the identification of parameters.
Results: A reduced model with 10 parameters is obtained and calibrated, showing
good fit to experimental data from pigs where insulin and glucagon boluses were
delivered in the intraperitoneal cavity. Conclusion: A simple model with
power--law kinetics can accurately represent glucose dynamics submitted to
intraperitoneal insulin and glucagon injections. The reduced model was found to
exhibit local practical as well as structural identifiability. Importance: The
proposed model facilitates intraperitoneal bi-hormonal model-based closed-loop
control in animal trials.

2011.05320,2020-11-11,"A Simple and Reliable Formula for Assessment of Maximum Volumetric
  Productivities in Photobioreactors","  This paper establishes and discusses the consistency and the range of
applicability of a simple, but general and predictive analytical formula,
enabling to easily assess the maximum volumetric biomass growth rates (the
productivities) in several kinds of photobioreactors with more or less 15
percents of deviation. Experimental validations are performed on
photobioreactors of very different conceptions and designs, cultivating the
cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis, on a wide range of volumes and
hemispherical incident light fluxes. The practical usefulness of the proposed
formula is demonstrated by the fact that it appears completely independent of
the characteristics of the material phase (as the type of reactor, the kind of
mixing, the biomass concentration), according to the first principle of
thermodynamics and to the Gauss-Ostrogradsky theorem. Its ability to give the
maximum (only) kinetic performance of photobioreactors cultivating many
different photoautotrophic strains (cyanobacteria, green algae, eukaryotic
microalgae) is theoretically discussed but experimental results are reported to
a future work of the authors or to any other contribution arising from the
scientific community working in the field of photobioreactor engineering and
potentially interested by this approach.

2011.05321,2020-11-11,"Spectral Kinetic Modeling and Long-term Behavior Assessment of
  Arthrospira platensis Growth in Photobioreactor under Red (620 nm) Light
  Illumination","  The ability to cultivate the cyanobacterium Arhtrospira platensis in
artificially lightened photobioreactors using high energetic efficiency
(quasi-monochromatic) red LED was investigated. In order to reach the same
maximal productivities as with the polychromatic lightening control conditions
(red + blue, P/2e- = 1.275), the need to work with an optimal range of
wavelength around 620 nm was first established on batch and continuous
cultures. The long-term physiological and kinetic behavior was then verified in
a continuous photobioreactor illuminated only with red (620 nm) LED, showing
that the maximum productivities can be maintained over 30 residence times with
only minor changes in the pigment content of the cells corresponding to a
well-known adaptation mechanism of the photosystems, but without any effect on
growth and stoichiometry. For both poly and monochromatic incident light
inputs, a predictive spectral knowledge model was proposed and validated for
the first time, allowing the calculation of the kinetics and stoichiometry
observed in any photobioreactor cultivating A. platensis, or other
cyanobacteria if the parameters were updated. It is shown that the photon flux
(with a specified wavelength) must be used instead of light energy flux as a
relevant control variable for the growth. The experimental and theoretical
results obtained in this study demonstrate that it is possible to save the
energy consumed by the lightening device of photobioreactors using red LED, the
spectral range of which is defined according to the action spectrum of
photosynthesis. This appears to be crucial information for applications in
which the energy must be rationalized, as it is the case for life support
systems in closed environments like a permanent spatial base or a submarine.

  a rapid untargeted chromatographic approach based on volatile compounds""","  Many studies have shown that the geographic origin is one of the most
influencing factors in the choice of olive oil. To avoid misleading, European
regulation has established specific rules to report the geographical origin of
extra virgin and virgin olive oils on the product label, but an official
analytical procedure to verify this information has not been yet defined. In
this work, a flash gas chromatography untargeted approach for determination of
volatile compounds, followed by a chemometric data elaboration, is proposed for
discrimination of EVOOs and VOOs according to their geographical origin (EU and
Extra-EU). A set of 210 samples was analyzed and two different classification
techniques were used, one linear and one non-linear. The two models were also
validated using an external data set. Satisfactory results were obtained for
both chemometric approaches: considering the PLS-DA, 89% and 81% of EU and
Extra-EU samples, respectively, were correctly classified; for ANN the
percentages were 93% and 89%, respectively. These results confirm the
reliability of the method as a rapid approach to discriminate EVOOs and VOOs
according to their geographical provenance.

2011.11099,2020-11-24,Paradox resolved: The allometric scaling of cancer risk across species,"  Understanding the cross-species behavior of cancer is important for
uncovering fundamental mechanisms of carcinogenesis, and for translating
results of model systems between species. One of the most famous interspecific
considerations of cancer is Peto's paradox, which asserts that organisms with
vastly different body mass are expected to have a vastly different degree of
cancer risk, a pattern that is not observed empirically. Here we show that this
observation is not a paradox at all but follows naturally from the
interspecific scaling of metabolic rates across mammalian body size. We connect
metabolic allometry to evolutionary models of cancer development in tissues to
show that waiting time to cancer scales with body mass in a similar way as
normal organism lifespan does. Thus, the expectation across mammals is that
lifetime cancer risk is invariant with body mass. Peto's observation is
therefore not a paradox, but the natural expectation from interspecific scaling
of metabolism and physiology. These allometric patterns have theoretical
implications for understanding life span evolution, and practical implications
for using smaller animals as model systems for human cancer.

2011.11578,2020-11-24,"Reliable LC-MS/MS-based method for trace level determination of 50
  medium to highly polar pesticide residues in sediments and ecological risk
  assessment","  The occurrence of polar pesticides in sediments has not been extensively
investigated because of their relatively poor hydrophobicity and apparently
less persistence in the environment. However, their continuous release into the
aquatic systems calls for the evaluation of their potential accumulation in
sediments and the role of this matrix as a potential source of these compounds.
Considering this, a method based on pressurized liquid extraction (PLE),
extract clean-up by solid phase extraction (SPE) and analyte determination by
liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was
developed and validated to analyze 50 relevant (frequently used and/or
regulated or found in water) medium to highly polar pesticides in sediments.
The method showed good performance regarding accuracy (relative recoveries
between 76% and 124%), precision (relative standard deviation values <20%),
sensitivity (LODs in the low ng/g for most compounds), linearity (coefficients
of determination >0.99), and matrix effects (negligible for all analytes). The
use of an isotope dilution approach for quantification ensures results
reliability. As a part of the validation process, the method was applied to the
analysis of the target pesticides in sediments from the Llobregat River (NE
Spain) showing the presence of five of them, namely, terbutryn, dichlorvos,
terbuthylazine, diazinon, and irgarol. All 5 pesticides, due to both the
concentrations found and their physical-chemical characteristics, demonstrate
high potential for bioaccumulation and risk to the aquatic organisms.
Additional multidisciplinary studies that investigate pesticides occurrence in
the different aquatic compartments and evaluate the potential risks for aquatic
ecosystems are required to assess the environmental impact and significance of
the presence of pesticides in sediments.

  highly polar pesticides in surface and groundwater and application in two
  distinct agriculture-impacted areas","  Water is an essential resource for all living organisms. The continuous and
increasing use of pesticides in agricultural and urban activities results in
the pollution of water resources and represents an environmental risk. To
control and reduce pesticide pollution, reliable multi-residue methods for the
detection of these compounds in water are needed. In this context, the present
work aimed at providing an analytical method for the simultaneous determination
of trace levels of 51 target pesticides in water and applying it to the
investigation of target pesticides in two agriculture-impacted areas of
interest. The method developed, based on an isotopic dilution approach and
on-line solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry,
is fast, simple, and to a large extent automated, and allows the analysis of
most of the target compounds in compliance with European regulations. Further
application of the method to the analysis of selected water samples collected
at the lowest stretches of the two largest river basins of Catalonia (NE
Spain), Llobregat and Ter, revealed the presence of a wide suite of pesticides,
and some of them at concentrations above the water quality standards (irgarol
and dichlorvos) or the acceptable method detection limits (methiocarb,
imidacloprid, and thiacloprid), in the Llobregat, and much cleaner waters in
the Ter River basin. Risk assessment of the pesticide concentrations measured
in the Llobregat indicated high risk due to the presence of irgarol,
dichlorvos, methiocarb, azinphos ethyl, imidacloprid, and diflufenican (hazard
quotient (HQ) values>10), and an only moderate potential risk in the Ter River
associated to the occurrence of bentazone and irgarol (HQ>1).

  evolution","  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2, has caused 60 millions of infections and 1.38 millions of
fatalities. Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 can provide insights on drug design
and vaccine development for controlling the pandemic. Inverted repeats in a
genome greatly impact the stability of the genome structure and regulate gene
expression. Inverted repeats involve cellular evolution and genetic diversity,
genome arrangements, and diseases. Here, we investigate the inverted repeats in
the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome. We found that SARS-CoV-2 genome has an
abundance of inverted repeats. The inverted repeats are mainly located in the
gene of the Spike protein. This result suggests the Spike protein gene
undergoes recombination events, therefore, is essential for fast evolution.
Comparison of the inverted repeat signatures in human and bat coronaviruses
suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is mostly related SARS-related coronavirus,
SARSr-CoV/RaTG13. The study also reveals that the recent SARS-related
coronavirus, SARSr-CoV/RmYN02, has a high amount of inverted repeats in the
spike protein gene. Besides, this study demonstrates that the inverted repeat
distribution in a genome can be considered as the genomic signature. This study
highlights the significance of inverted repeats in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2
and presents the inverted repeats as the genomic signature in genome analysis.

  Study","  The virus SARS-CoV-2 has created a situation of global emergency all over the
world from the last few months. We are witnessing a helpless situation due to
COVID-19 as no vaccine or drug is effective against the disease. In the present
study, we have tested the applicability of some combination drugs against
COVID-19. We have tried to understand the mechanism of action of some
repurposed drugs: Favipiravir (F), Hydroxychloroquine (H) and Oseltamivir (O).
The ADME analysis have suggested strong inhibitory possibility of F, H, O
combination towards receptor protein of $3CL^{pro}$ of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The
strong binding affinity, number of hydrogen bond interaction between inhibitor,
receptor and lower inhibition constant computed from molecular docking
validated the better complexation possibility of F+H+O: $3CL^{pro}$
combination. Various thermodynamical output from Molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations like potential energy ($E_g$), temperature (T), density, pressure,
SASA energy, interaction energies, Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G_{bind}$) etc.,
also favored the complexation between F+H+O and CoV-2 protease. Our In-Silico

at the crossing point between information technology and agricultural science,
to study all aspects in the life cycle of semantic resources:
conceptualization, edition, sharing, standardization, services, alignment, long

the uses of semantics in agrifood, then collected use cases for the
exploitation of semantics resources-a generic term to encompass vocabularies,
terminologies, thesauri, ontologies. The resulting requirements were
synthesized into 39 ""hints"" for users and developers of semantic resources, and
providers of semantic resource services. We believe adopting these
recommendations will engage agrifood sciences in a necessary transition to
leverage data production, sharing and reuse and the adoption of the FAIR data
principles. The paper includes examples of adoption of those requirements, and
a discussion of their contribution to the field of data science.

2012.11648,2021-05-21,Rosen's no-go theorem for regular categories,"  The famous biologist Robert Rosen argued for an intrinsic difference between
biological and artificial life, supporting the claim that `living systems are
not mechanisms'. This result, understood as the claim that life-like mechanisms
are non-computable, can be phrased as the non-existence of an equivalence
between a category of `static'/analytic elements and a category of
`variable'/synthetic elements.
  The property of a system of being synthetic, understood as being the gluing
of `variable families' of analytica, must imply that the latter class of
objects does not retain sufficient information in order to describe said
variability; we contribute to this thesis with an argument rooted in elementary
category theory.
  Seen as such, Rosen's `proof' that no living system can be a mechanism arises
from a tension between two contrapuntal needs: on one side, the necessity to
consider (synthetically) variable families of systems; on the other, the
necessity to describe a syntheticum via an universally chosen analyticum.

proteomes are searched with blastp. 3-) Binding predictions of the identified
SARS-CoV-2 peptide to MHC class I supertype representatives are performed. 4-)
Blastp searches of predicted-epitopes that bind strongly to the identified HLA

  Learning","  In this paper, we present machine learning models based on random forest
classifiers, support vector machines, gradient boosted decision trees, and
artificial neural networks to predict participation in cancer screening
programs in South Korea. The top performing model was based on gradient boosted
decision trees and achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.8706 and average precision of 0.8776. The results of this
study are encouraging and suggest that with further research, these models can
be directly applied to Korea's healthcare system, thus increasing participation
in Korea's National Cancer Screening Program.

  Candidate Therapeutics for COVID-19 in the CORD-19 Corpus","  Scientific literature tends to grow as a function of funding and interest in
a given field. Mining such literature can reveal trends that may not be
immediately apparent. The CORD-19 corpus represents a growing corpus of
scientific literature associated with COVID-19. We examined the intersection of
a set of candidate therapeutics identified in a drug-repurposing study with
temporal instances of the CORD-19 corpus to determine if it was possible to
find and measure changes associated with them over time. We propose that the
techniques we used could form the basis of a tool to pre-screen new candidate
therapeutics early in the research process.

2102.01522,2021-12-08,"If Loud Aliens Explain Human Earliness, Quiet Aliens Are Also Rare","  If life on Earth had to achieve n 'hard steps' to reach humanity's level,
then the chance of this event rose as time to the n-th power. Integrating this
over habitable star formation and planet lifetime distributions predicts >99%
of advanced life appears after today, unless n<3 and max planet duration
<50Gyr. That is, we seem early. We offer this explanation: a deadline is set by
'loud' aliens who are born according to a hard steps power law, expand at a
common rate, change their volumes' appearances, and prevent advanced life like
us from appearing in their volumes. 'Quiet' aliens, in contrast, are much
harder to see. We fit this three-parameter model of loud aliens to data: 1)
birth power from the number of hard steps seen in Earth history, 2) birth
constant by assuming a inform distribution over our rank among loud alien birth
dates, and 3) expansion speed from our not seeing alien volumes in our sky. We
estimate that loud alien civilizations now control 40-50% of universe volume,
each will later control ~10^5 - 3x10^7 galaxies, and we could meet them in
~200Myr - 2Gyr. If loud aliens arise from quiet ones, a depressingly low
transition chance (~10^-4) is required to expect that even one other quiet
alien civilization has ever been active in our galaxy. Which seems bad news for
SETI. But perhaps alien volume appearances are subtle, and their expansion
speed lower, in which case we predict many long circular arcs to find in our
sky.

  against respiratory infection causing bacteria","  The plants, Althaea officinalis, Tilia cordata and Psidium guaja have been
used traditionally to treat respiratory infection symptoms. Flowers of A.
officinalis and leaves of T. cordata and P. guaja have been used to treat
cough, sore throat, catarrh, oral and pharyngeal mucosa irritation. Therefore,
this study was designed to examine the antibacterial and antibiofilm effects of
these plants individually as well as in combination, as a formula against
respiratory infections causing pathogens. The tested pathogens were Extended
Spectrum Beta-Lactamase producing Escherichia coli (ESBL), Beta-Lactamase
producing Escherichia coli (BL), Beta-Lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae
(BL), Beta-Lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (BL), Enterobacter
cloacae, and Beta-Lactamase producing Staphylococcus aureus (BL). The tested
plants were extracted using ethanol and then fractionated using different
polarity solvents (hexane, ethyl acetate and water). Disc diffusion and
microdilution (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) methods were used to evaluate
the antibacterial activity while the antibiofilm activity was tested using
crystal violet assay. The results showed that A. officinalis and T. cordata
extracts and fractions exhibited weak antibacterial activity having MIC values
ranged from 6.25 to 12.5 mg/mL. P. guaja exhibited moderate antibacterial
activity with MIC values ranged from 6.25 to 1.56 mg/mL. Combination between
these plants extracts and fractions in equal proportion provides stronger
antibacterial (with MIC values ranged from 6.25 to 0.8 mg/mL) and antibiofilm
activities (MBIC50 was 0.2 mg/mL). Therefore, this study provides a valuable
scientific knowledge to support the use of plants in combination rather than
individually.

  the Spike protein circulating in the Czech Republic and Slovakia","  SARS-CoV-2 mutants carrying the $\Delta$H69/$\Delta$V70 deletion in the amino
terminal domain of the Spike protein emerged independently in at least six
lineages of the virus (namely, B.1.1.7, B.1.1.298, B.1.160, B.1.177, B.1.258,
B.1.375). Routine RT-qPCR tests including TaqPath or similar assays based on a
drop-out of the Spike gene target are incapable of distinguishing among these
lineages and often lead to the false conclusion that clinical samples contain
the B.1.1.7 variant, which recently emerged in the United Kingdom and is
quickly spreading through the human population. We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 samples
collected from various regions of Slovakia between November and December 2020
that were presumed to contain the B.1.1.7 variant due to traveling history of
the virus carriers or their contacts. Sequencing of these isolates revealed
that although in some cases the samples were indeed confirmed as B.1.1.7, a
substantial fraction of isolates contained another $\Delta$H69/$\Delta$V70
carrying mutant belonging to the lineage B.1.258, which has been circulating in
Central Europe since August 2020, long before the import of B.1.1.7.
Phylogenetic analysis shows that the early sublineage of B.1.258 acquired the
N439K substitution in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein
and, later on, also the deletion $\Delta$H69/$\Delta$V70 in the Spike
N-terminal domain (NTD). This variant is particularly common in several
European countries including Czech Republic and Slovakia, and we propose to
name it B.1.258$\Delta$.

2102.04842,2021-02-10,"Schr\""{o}dinger's ""What is Life?"" at 75","  2019 marked the 75th anniversary of the publication of Erwin
Schr\""{o}dinger's ""What is Life?"", a short book described by Roger Penrose in
his preface to a reprint of this classic as ""among the most influential
scientific writings of the 20th century."" In this article, I review the long
argument made by Schr\""{o}dinger as he mused on how the laws of physics could
help us understand ""the events in space and time which take place within the
spatial boundary of a living organism."" Though Schr\""{o}dinger's book is often
hailed for its influence on some of the titans who founded molecular biology,
this article takes a different tack. Instead of exploring the way the book
touched biologists such as James Watson and Francis Crick, as well as its
critical reception by others such as Linus Pauling and Max Perutz, I argue that
Schr\""{o}dinger's classic is a timeless manifesto, rather than a dated
historical curiosity. ""What is Life?"" is full of timely outlooks and approaches
to understanding the mysterious living world that includes and surrounds us and
can instead be viewed as a call to arms to tackle the great unanswered
challenges in the study of living matter that remain for 21$^{st}$ century

2103.01313,2021-03-03,Towards Understanding the COVID-19 Case Fatality Rate,"  An important parameter for COVID-19 is the case fatality rate (CFR). It has
been applied to wide applications, including the measure of the severity of the
infection, the estimation of the number of infected cases, risk assessment etc.
However, there remains a lack of understanding on several aspects of CFR,
including population factors that are important to CFR, the apparent
discrepancy of CFRs in different countries, and how the age effect comes into
play. We analyze the CFRs at two different time snapshots, July 6 and Dec 28,
2020, with one during the first wave and the other a second wave of the
COVID-19 pandemic. We consider two important population covariates, age and GDP
as a proxy for the quality and abundance of public health. Extensive
exploratory data analysis leads to some interesting findings. First, there is a
clear exponential age effect among different age groups, and, more importantly,
the exponential index is almost invariant across countries and time in the
pandemic. Second, the roles played by the age and GDP are a little surprising:
during the first wave, age is a more significant factor than GDP, while their
roles have switched during the second wave of the pandemic, which may be
partially explained by the delay in time for the quality and abundance of
public health and medical research to factor in.

2103.01959,2022-07-04,Dynamic and Thermodynamic Models of Adaptation,"  The concept of biological adaptation was closely connected to some
mathematical, engineering and physical ideas from the very beginning. Cannon in
his ""The wisdom of the body"" (1932) used the engineering vision of regulation.
In 1938, Selye enriched this approach by the notion of adaptation energy. This
term causes much debate when one takes it literally, i.e. as a sort of energy.
Selye did not use the language of mathematics, but the formalization of his
phenomenological theory in the spirit of thermodynamics was simple and led to
verifiable predictions. In 1980s, the dynamics of correlation and variance in
systems under adaptation to a load of environmental factors were studied and
the universal effect in ensembles of systems under a load of similar factors
was discovered: in a crisis, as a rule, even before the onset of obvious
symptoms of stress, the correlation increases together with variance (and
volatility). During 30 years, this effect has been supported by many
observations of groups of humans, mice, trees, grassy plants, and on financial
time series. In the last ten years, these results were supplemented by many new
experiments, from gene networks in cardiology and oncology to dynamics of
depression and clinical psychotherapy. Several systems of models were
developed: the thermodynamic-like theory of adaptation of ensembles and several
families of models of individual adaptation. Historically, the first group of
models was based on Selye's concept of adaptation energy and used fitness
estimates. Two other groups of models are based on the idea of hidden attractor
bifurcation and on the advection--diffusion model for distribution of
population in the space of physiological attributes. We explore this world of
models and experiments, starting with classic works, with particular attention
to the results of the last ten years and open questions.

2103.02436,2021-08-16,"Dimensional Reduction in Complex Living Systems: Where, Why, and How","  The unprecedented prowess of measurement techniques provides a detailed,
multi-scale look into the depths of living systems. Understanding these
avalanches of high-dimensional data -- by distilling underlying principles and
mechanisms -- necessitates dimensional reduction. We propose that living
systems achieve exquisite dimensional reduction, originating from their
capacity to learn, through evolution and phenotypic plasticity, the relevant
aspects of a non-random, smooth physical reality. We explain how geometric
insights by mathematicians allow one to identify these genuine hallmarks of
life and distinguish them from universal properties of generic data sets. We
illustrate these principles in a concrete example of protein evolution,
suggesting a simple general recipe that can be applied to understand other
biological systems.

2103.05431,2021-03-10,"Sustainable improvement of seeds vigor using dry atmospheric plasma
  priming: evidence through coating wettability, water uptake and plasma
  reactive chemistry","  Lentil seeds have been packed in a dielectric barrier device and exposed for
several minutes to a cold atmospheric plasma generated in helium with/without a
reactive gas (nitrogen or oxygen). While no impact is evidenced on germination
rates (caping nearly at 100% with/without plasma exposure), seeds vigor is
clearly improved with a median germination time decreasing from 1850 min (31h)
to 1500 min (26 h), hence representing a time saving of at least 5 hours. We
show that the admixture of nitrogen to helium can further increase this time
saving up to 8 hours. Contrarily, we demonstrate that the addition of molecular
oxygen to the helium discharge does not promote seeds vigor. Whatever the
plasma chemistry utilized, these biological effects are accompanied with strong
hydrophilization of the seed coating (with a decrease in contact angles from
118{\deg} to 25{\deg}) as well as increased water absorption (water uptakes
measured 8 hours after imbibition are close to 50% for plasma-treated seeds
instead of 37% for seeds from the control group). A follow-up of the seeds over
a 45-days ageing period shows the sustainability of the plasma-triggered
biological effects: whatever the plasma treatment, seeds vigor remains stable
and much higher than for seeds unexposed to plasma). For these reasons, the
seed-packed dielectric barrier device (SP-DBD) supplied with a He-N2 gas
mixture can be considered as a relevant dry atmospheric priming plasma (DAPP)
in the same way as those used in routine by seed companies.

2104.00684,2021-06-25,Defining the lead time of wastewater-based epidemiology for COVID-19,"  Individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, may
shed the virus in stool before developing symptoms, suggesting that
measurements of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater could be a ""leading
indicator"" of COVID-19 prevalence. Multiple studies have corroborated the
leading indicator concept by showing that the correlation between wastewater
measurements and COVID-19 case counts is maximized when case counts are lagged.
However, the meaning of ""leading indicator"" will depend on the specific
application of wastewater-based epidemiology, and the correlation analysis is
not relevant for all applications. In fact, the quantification of a leading
indicator will depend on epidemiological, biological, and health systems
factors. Thus, there is no single ""lead time"" for wastewater-based COVID-19
monitoring. To illustrate this complexity, we enumerate three different
applications of wastewater-based epidemiology for COVID-19: a qualitative
""early warning"" system; an independent, quantitative estimate of disease
prevalence; and a quantitative alert of bursts of disease incidence. The
leading indicator concept has different definitions and utility in each
application.

2104.10031,2021-04-21,Theoretical Modeling of Structure-Toxicity Relationship of Cyanides,"  The global descriptors of chemical activity:ionization potential IP, electron
affinity EA, chemical potential mu, absolute electronegativity chi, molecular
hardness eta and softness S,electrophilicity index omega for cyanides X(CN)k
with X=H, Na, K, Ag, Cu, Ca, Hg, Cd, Zn in the gas phase and water medium have
been determined by taking advantage of the quantum-chemical computations.To
this aim, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated using DFT B3LYP
method and QZVP (Valence Quadruple-Zeta Polarization) basis set, which enables
precise calculations for hydrogen cyanide and its salts containing both light
(H, Na, Ca) and heavy (K, Ag, Cu, Cd, Hg, Zn) atoms.The results obtained
indicate that while the EA-parameter roughly determines the LD50 values for the
cyanides considered, the omega-descriptor is related rather to the product of
cyanide LD50 and hydrolysis n-degree.Hence,the theoretical LD50CN(omega)
function proposed is interconnected with the nLD50 collective variable, whereas
LD50(EA)directly approximates LD50 indicating that the toxicity of cyanides
decreases with increasing EA, omega-values.The calculations carried out suggest
that some of the LD50(Exp)experimentally determined are incorrect (AgCN) or
inaccurate (Cd(CN)2) and require revision.Comparison of the theoretically
estimated LD50(omega) with NOAEL toxicity parameters indicates that they are
well correlated in contrast to LD50(EA) and LD50(Exp), exhibiting lower and
marginal degrees of correlation, respectively.

2105.01540,2021-05-05,A Gentle Introduction to Scaling Laws in Biological Systems,"  This paper investigates the role of size in biological organisms. More
specifically, how the energy demand, expressed by the metabolic rate, changes
according to the mass of an organism. Empirical evidence suggests a power-law
relation between mass and metabolic rate, namely allometric law. For vascular
organisms, the exponent $\beta$ of this power-law is smaller than one, which
implies scaling economy; that is, the greater the organism is, the lesser
energy per cell it demands. However, the numerical value of this exponent is a
theme of an extensive debate and a central issue in comparative physiology. It
is presented in this work some empirical data and a detailed discussion about
the most successful theories to explain these issues. A historical perspective
is also shown, beginning with the first empirical insights in the sec. 19 about
scaling properties in biology, passing through the two more important theories
that explain the scaling properties quantitatively. Firstly, the Rubner model,
that consider organism surface area and heat dissipation to derive $\beta =
2/3$. Secondly, the West-Brown-Enquist theory, that explains such scaling
properties as a consequence of the hierarchical and fractal nutrient
distribution network, deriving $\beta = 3/4$.

2105.05672,2021-05-13,Assessing ecosystem services for evidence-based nature-based solutions,"  The term nature-based solutions has often been used to refer to adequate
green infrastructure, which is cost-effective and simultaneously provides
environmental, social and economic benefits, through the delivery of ecosystem
services, and contributes to build resilience. This paper provides an overview
of the recent work mapping and assessing ecosystem services in Malta and the
implications for decision-making. Research has focused on the identification
and mapping of ecosystems, and ecosystem condition, the capacity to deliver key
ecosystem services and the actual use (flow) of these services by local
communities leading to benefits to human well-being. The integration of results
from these different assessments demonstrates several significant synergies
between ecosystem services, indicating multifunctionality in the provision of
ecosystem services leading to human well-being. This is considered as key
criterion in the identification of green infrastructure in the Maltese Islands.
A gradient in green infrastructure cover and ecosystem services capacity is
observed between rural and urban areas but ecosystem services flow per unit
area was in some cases higher in urban environments. These results indicate a
potential mismatch between ecosystem service demand and capacity but also
provide a scientific baseline for evidence-based policy which fosters the
development of green infrastructure through nature-based innovation promoting
more specific and novel solutions for landscape and urban planning.

2105.07865,2021-05-18,"An appeal for an open scientific debate about the proximal origin of
  SARS-CoV-2","  One year after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the origin of SARS-CoV-2
still eludes humanity. Early publications firmly stated that the virus was of
natural origin, and the possibility that the virus might have escaped from a
lab was discarded in most subsequent publications. However, based on a
re-analysis of the initial arguments, highlighted by the current knowledge
about the virus, we show that the natural origin is not supported by conclusive
arguments, and that a lab origin cannot be formally discarded. We call for an
opening of peer-reviewed journals to a rational, evidence-based and
prejudice-free evaluation of all the reasonable hypotheses about the virus'
origin. We advocate that this debate should take place in the columns of
renowned scientific journals, rather than being left to social media and

3D BRAIN Microscopy includes 91 fields organized into seven categories:
Contributors, Funders, Publication, Instrument, Dataset, Specimen, and Image.
Adoption of these metadata standards will ensure that investigators receive
credit for their work, promote data reuse, facilitate downstream analysis of
shared data, and encourage collaboration.

2105.10865,2021-05-25,"Blessing or Curse of Democracy?: Current Evidence from the Covid-19
  Pandemic","  Background: A major question in Covid-19 research is whether democracies
handled the Covid-19 pandemic crisis better or worse than authoritarian
countries. However, it is important to consider the issues of democracy versus
authoritarianism, and state fragility, when examining official Covid-19 death
counts in research, because these factors can influence the accurate reporting
of pandemic deaths by governments. In contrast, excess deaths are less prone to
variability in differences in definitions of Covid-19 deaths and testing
capacities across countries. Here we use excess pandemic deaths to explore
potential relationships between political systems and public health outcomes.
  Methods: We address these issues by comparing the official government
Covid-19 death counts in a well-established John Hopkins database to the
generally more reliable excess mortality measure of Covid-19 deaths, taken from
the recently released World Mortality Dataset. We put the comparison in the
context of the political and fragile state dimensions.
  Findings: We find (1) significant potential underreporting of Covid-19 deaths
by authoritarian governments and governments with high state fragility and (2)
substantial geographic variation among countries and regions with regard to
standard democracy indices. Additionally, we find that more authoritarian
governments are (weakly) associated with more excess deaths during the pandemic
than democratic governments.
  Interpretations: The inhibition and censorship of information flows, inherent
to authoritarian states, likely results in major inaccuracies in pandemic
statistics that confound global public health analyses. Thus, both excess
pandemic deaths and official Covid-19 death counts should be examined in
studies using death as an outcome variable.

2105.14372,2022-05-04,Ten Quick Tips for Deep Learning in Biology,"  Machine learning is a modern approach to problem-solving and task automation.
In particular, machine learning is concerned with the development and
applications of algorithms that can recognize patterns in data and use them for
predictive modeling. Artificial neural networks are a particular class of
machine learning algorithms and models that evolved into what is now described
as deep learning. Given the computational advances made in the last decade,
deep learning can now be applied to massive data sets and in innumerable
contexts. Therefore, deep learning has become its own subfield of machine
learning. In the context of biological research, it has been increasingly used
to derive novel insights from high-dimensional biological data. To make the
biological applications of deep learning more accessible to scientists who have
some experience with machine learning, we solicited input from a community of
researchers with varied biological and deep learning interests. These
individuals collaboratively contributed to this manuscript's writing using the
GitHub version control platform and the Manubot manuscript generation toolset.
The goal was to articulate a practical, accessible, and concise set of
guidelines and suggestions to follow when using deep learning. In the course of
our discussions, several themes became clear: the importance of understanding
and applying machine learning fundamentals as a baseline for utilizing deep
learning, the necessity for extensive model comparisons with careful
evaluation, and the need for critical thought in interpreting results generated
by deep learning, among others.

  obtained by neutron irradiation","  Irradiation breeding is an important technique in the effort to solve food
shortages and improve the quality of agricultural products. In this study, a
field test was implemented on the M3 generation of two mutant pea plants gained
from previous neutron radiation of pea seeds. The relationship between
agronomic characteristics and yields of the mutants was investigated. Moreover,
differences in physiological and biochemical properties and seed nutrients were
analyzed. The results demonstrated that the plant height, effective pods per
plant, and yield per plant of mutant Leaf-M1 were 45.0%, 43.2%, and 50.9%
higher than those of the control group. Further analysis attributed the
increase in yield per plant to the increased branching number. The yield per
plant of mutant Leaf-M2 was 7.8% higher than that of the control group, which
could be related with the increased chlorophyll content in the leaves. There
was a significant difference between the two mutants in the increase of yield
per plant owing to morphological variation between the two mutants. There were
significant differences in SOD activity and MDA content between the two mutants
and the control, indicating that the physiological regulation of the two
mutants also changed. In addition, the iron element content of seeds of the two
mutants were about 10.9% lower than in the seeds of the control group, a
significant difference. These findings indicate that the mutants Leaf-M1 and
Leaf-M2 have breeding value and material value for molecular biological
studies.

  spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic of 2020","  Lockdowns imposed in most of the countries were lifted following a decline in
the COVID-19 cases towards May-June 2020. A recent surge (second wave) in the
COVID-19 cases in Europe and other temperate countries as compared to the
tropical regions suggests the likely role of solar radiation. We hypothesized
that ultraviolet radiation's effect might be a significant factor moderating
the spread of the COVID-19 across countries. Regression analysis was done for
the UV radiation data for seven hotspot cities (New Delhi, Mumbai, Milan,
Madrid, New York, Melbourne and Sydney) with the daily COVID-19 cases. Global
erythemal UV radiation values were lower during winter and higher during
summer. In general, the daily new COVID-19 cases registered were higher during
the winter months having low UV radiation dose (0.5-3.7 kJ m-2). Cases began to
decline with summer onset that corresponded to increased UV radiation (2.5-6.7
kJ m-2). Our studies suggest that the natural UV radiation could be a strong
determining factor moderating the spread of COVID-19 cases. The importance of
UV radiation in natural sunlight as a disinfectant for SARS-CoV-2 cannot be
ignored since the lockdowns were lifted; further, it can be considered as a
factor for COVID management.

assembly-packaging signals (RNAPS) in the genomes of all seven known pathogenic
human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1,
HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 and compared them with RNAPS in the genomes of the
related animal coronaviruses including SARS-Bat-CoV, MERS-Camel-CoV, MHV,
Bat-CoV MOP1, TGEV, and one of camel alphacoronaviruses. RNAPS in the genomes
of coronaviruses were evolved due to weakly specific interactions between
genomic RNA and N proteins in helical nucleocapsids. Combining transitional
genome mapping and Jaccard correlation coefficients allows us to perform the
analysis directly in terms of underlying motifs distributed over the genome. In
all coronaviruses RNAPS were distributed quasi-periodically over the genome
with the period about 54 nt biased to 57 nt and to 51 nt for the genomes longer
and shorter than that of SARS-CoV, respectively. The comparison with the
experimentally verified packaging signals for MERS-CoV, MHV, and TGEV proved
that the distribution of particular motifs is strongly correlated with the
packaging signals. We also found that many motifs were highly conserved in both
characters and positioning on the genomes throughout the lineages that make
them promising therapeutic targets. The mechanisms of encapsidation can affect
the recombination and co-infection as well.

2107.01376,2021-07-06,"Study of conduction, block and reflection at the excitable tissues
  boundary in terms of the interval model of action potential","  Some mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias can be presented as a composition of
elementary acts of block and reflection on the contacts of homogeneous areas of
the conducting tissue. For study this phenomena we use an axiomatic
one-dimensional model of interaction of cells of excitable tissue. The model
has four functional parameters that determine the functional states durations
of the cell. We show that the cells of a homogeneous excitable tissue,
depending on the ratio of the durations of the functional intervals, can
operate in the mode of solitary waves conduction or in one of three modes of
selfgeneration. It is proved that the propagation of a solitary wave through
the boundary of homogeneous conducting tissues can be accompanied by a block or
multiplex reflection. Block and reflection are unidirectional phenomena, and
there are not compatible on the same boundary. Systematized rules of
transmitting, block and reflection waves at the boundary of homogeneous
conducting tissues open up new possibilities for design mechanisms of
generation and analyzing complex heart rate patterns.

  consultation","  How will the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic develop in the
coming months and years? Based on an expert survey, we examine key aspects that
are likely to influence COVID-19 in Europe. The future challenges and
developments will strongly depend on the progress of national and global
vaccination programs, the emergence and spread of variants of concern, and
public responses to nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). In the short term,
many people are still unvaccinated, VOCs continue to emerge and spread, and
mobility and population mixing is expected to increase over the summer.
Therefore, policies that lift restrictions too much and too early risk another
damaging wave. This challenge remains despite the reduced opportunities for
transmission due to vaccination progress and reduced indoor mixing in the
summer. In autumn 2021, increased indoor activity might accelerate the spread
again, but a necessary reintroduction of NPIs might be too slow. The incidence
may strongly rise again, possibly filling intensive care units, if vaccination
levels are not high enough. A moderate, adaptive level of NPIs will thus remain
necessary. These epidemiological aspects are put into perspective with the
economic, social, and health-related consequences and thereby provide a
holistic perspective on the future of COVID-19.

  Adversarial Networks","  Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly morbid and lethal disease with poor prognosis.
Their emergent properties such as cellular heterogeneity, therapy resistance,
and self-renewal are largely attributed to the interactions between a subset of
their population known as glioblastoma-derived stem cells (GSCs) and their
microenvironment. Identifying causal patterns in the developmental trajectories
between GSCs and the mature, well-differentiated GBM phenotypes remains a
challenging problem in oncology. The paper presents a blueprint of complex
systems approaches to infer attractor dynamics from the single-cell gene
expression datasets of pediatric GBM and adult GSCs. These algorithms include
Waddington landscape reconstruction, Generative Adversarial Networks, and
fractal dimension analysis. Here I show, a Rossler-like strange attractor with
a fractal dimension of roughly 1.7 emerged in the GAN-reconstructed patterns of
all twelve patients. The findings suggest a strange attractor may be driving
the complex dynamics and adaptive behaviors of GBM in signaling state-space.

  Models","  Recent studies have shown that the majority of published computational models
in systems biology and physiology are not repeatable or reproducible. There are
a variety of reasons for this. One of the most likely reasons is that given how
busy modern researchers are and the fact that no credit is given to authors for
publishing repeatable work, it is inevitable that this will be the case. The
situation can only be rectified when government agencies, universities and
other research institutions change policies and that journals begin to insist
that published work is in fact at least repeatable if not reproducible. In this
chapter guidelines are described that can be used by researchers to help make
sure their work is repeatable. A scoring system is suggested that authors can
use to determine how well they are doing.

  magnetic field exposure on yeast colony growth and morphology","  Yeasts exist in communities that expand over space and time to form complex
structures and patterns. We developed a computational lattice-based framework
to perform spatial-temporal simulations of budding yeast colonies exposed to
different nutrient and magnetic field conditions. The budding patterns of
haploid and diploid yeast cells were incorporated into the framework, as well
as the filamentous growth that occurs in yeast colonies under nutrient limiting
conditions. Simulation of the lattice-based model predicted that magnetic
fields decrease colony growth rate, density, and roundness. Magnetic field
simulations further predicted that colony elongation and boundary fluctuations
increase in a nutrient- and ploidy-dependent manner. These in-silico
predictions are an important step towards understanding the effects of the
physico-chemical environment on microbial colonies and for informing
bioelectromagnetic experiments on yeast colony biofilms and fungal pathogens.

  Extracellular Vesicles using Vibrational Spectroscopies","  The early detection of cancer is a challenging problem in medicine. The blood
sera of cancer patients are enriched with heterogeneous secretory lipid bound
extracellular vesicles (EVs), which present a complex repertoire of information
and biomarkers, representing their cell of origin, that are being currently
studied in the field of liquid biopsy and cancer screening. Vibrational
spectroscopies provide non-invasive approaches for the assessment of structural
and biophysical properties in complex biological samples. In this pilot study,
multiple Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed on the EVs extracted
from the blood sera of 9 patients consisting of four different cancer subtypes
(colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer and pancreatic
cancer) and five healthy patients (controls). FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared)
spectroscopy measurements were performed as a complementary approach to Raman
analysis, on two of the four cancer subtypes. The AdaBoost Random Forest
Classifier, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) distinguished the
baseline corrected Raman spectra of cancer EVs from those of healthy controls
(18 spectra) with a classification accuracy of above 90 percent when reduced to
a spectral frequency range of 1800 to 1940 inverse cm and subjected to a 50:50
training: testing split. FTIR classification accuracy on 14 spectra showed an
80 percent classification accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that basic machine
learning algorithms are powerful applied intelligence tools to distinguish the
complex vibrational spectra of cancer patient EVs from those of healthy
patients. These experimental methods hold promise as valid and efficient liquid

2107.13418,2021-07-29,The mystery of energy compensation,"  The received wisdom on how activity affects energy expenditure is that the
more activity is undertaken, the more calories will have been burned by the end
of the day. Yet traditional hunter-gatherers, who lead physically hard lives,
burn no more calories each day than western populations living in labour-saving
environments. Indeed, there is now a wealth of data, both for humans and other
animals, demonstrating that long-term lifestyle changes involving increases in
exercise or other physical activities do not result in commensurate increases
in daily energy expenditure (DEE). This is because humans and other animals
exhibit a degree of energy compensation at the organismal level, ameliorating
some of the increases in DEE that would occur from the increased activity by
decreasing the energy expended on other biological processes. And energy
compensation can be sizable, reaching many hundreds of calories in humans. But
the processes that are downregulated in the long-term to achieve energy
compensation are far from clear, particularly in humans. We do not know how
energy compensation is achieved. My review here of the literature on relevant
exercise intervention studies, for both humans and other species, indicates
conflict regarding the role that basal metabolic rate (BMR) or low level
activity such as fidgeting play, if any, particularly once changes in body
composition are factored out. In situations where BMR and low-level activity
are not major components of energy compensation, what then drives it? I discuss
how changes in mitochondrial efficiency and changes in circadian fluctuations
in BMR may contribute to our understanding of energy management. Currently
unexplored, these mechanisms and others may provide important insights into the
mystery of how energy compensation is achieved.

principles (including FAIR), highly-trained and highly-paid scientists are
forced to spend time dealing with technical problems, which can ultimately
costs more than providing storage and a fast network on campus. Here we provide
concise arguments for better infrastructure, blueprints of possible solutions,

crucial role in motor function of intestine. Qualitative analysis of dynamical
models using myogenic active property of smooth muscles has shown well
agreement with physiologic data. Considered as a self-regulatory unit, function
of gastrointestinal (GI) segment is assumed to be regulated by integration of
basis patterns providing accumulation and propagation of intestinal content. By
implementing external, depending on neural system, variable to the previous
model, and considering two attaches to one another reservoirs as a physical
analogue of the segmental partition of intestine, a system of six ODE
equations, three for each reservoir, describes coordinated wall motions and
propagation of the content from one reservoir to another. It was shown that
besides negative feedback (NFB), other functional patterns, namely positive
feedback (PFB) and reciprocal links (RL) are involved in regulations of
filling-emptying cycle. Being integrated in a whole functional system these
three patterns expressed in a matrix form represent basis elements of imaginary

2109.11616,2021-09-27,"Fetal oxygen delivery and consumption and blood gases in relation to
  gestational age","  Fetal oxygen delivery and consumption and blood gases in relation to
gestational age. Oxygen crosses the placenta by diffusion and placental
permeability to O$_2$ is high. Thus, the fetus receives adequate amounts, but
vascular Po$_2$ is much lower than after birth. Studies of sustained fetal
hypoxemia and acute 40-45% hemorrhage show that hypoxemia is not tolerated
whereas hemorrhage is. This suggests that if fetal Po$_2$ falls markedly, O$_2$
diffusion from blood to tissue is impaired. Uterine blood and umbilical blood
flows/fetal weight fall progressively with advancing gestation. This results in
fetal hypoxemia, an increase in Pco$_2$, and decrease in pH. This decreases
fetal O$_2$ delivery, and in fetal lambs and horses there is a decrease in
fetal O$_2$ consumption. The decrease in O$_2$ demands is linked to a decrease
in fetal breathing and body movements and growth rate. The decrease in fetal
motility is due to an increase in fetal plasma PGE2 concentration, which begins
at ~120 days GA in sheep and is due to the prepartum rise in fetal cortisol.
Also, adenosine administration to fetal lambs decreases fetal breathing and REM
sleep and the plasma adenosine concentration increases in late gestation. The
fetal plasma levels of neurosteroids, which suppress fetal motility, increase
with advancing gestation. The prepartum cortisol rise also inhibits fetal
growth. In normal pregnancies, these mechanisms operate effectively to maintain
an appropriate balance between fetal oxygen consumption and delivery. However,
in pregnancies with either further reduce O$_2$ delivery or increase fetal
O$_2$ demands, the mismatch between O$_2$ delivery and consumption may worsen
leading to IUGR, hypoxic organ damage or stillbirth.

Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). In the first model, we consider the case of
single dose of drug in the human system and in the second case, we consider the

using PINN, where we employ a feed forward multilayer perceptron as function
approximator and the network parameters are tuned for minimum error. Further,
the network is trained by finding the gradient of the error function with
respect to the network parameters. We have employed DeepXDE, a python library

  trajectory and origin of SARS-CoV-2","  A genome, composed of a precisely ordered sequence of four nucleotides
(ATCG), encompasses a multitude of specific genome features like AAA motif.
Mutations occurring within a genome disrupt the sequential order and
composition of these features, thereby influencing the evolutionary
trajectories and yielding variants. The evolutionary relatedness between a
variant and its ancestor can be estimated by assessing evolutionary distances
across a spectrum of genome features. This study develops a novel,
alignment-free algorithm that considers both the sequential order and
composition of genome features, enabling computation of the Fr\'echet distance
(Fr) across multiple genome features to quantify the evolutionary status of a
variant. Integrating this algorithm with an artificial recurrent neural network
(RNN) reveals the quantitative evolutionary trajectory and origin of
SARS-CoV-2, a puzzle unsolved by alignment-based phylogenetics. The RNN
generates the evolutionary trajectory from Fr data at two levels: genome
sequence mutations and organism variants. At the genome sequence level,
SARS-CoV-2 evolutionarily shortens its genome to enhance its infectious
capacity. Mutating signature features, such as TTA and GCT, increases its
infectious potential and drives its evolution. At the organism level, variants
mutating a single biomarker possess low infectious potential. However, mutating
multiple markers dramatically increases their infectious capacity, propelling
the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 likely originates from mink coronavirus
variants, with its origin trajectory traced as follows: mink, cat, tiger,
mouse, hamster, dog, lion, gorilla, leopard, bat, and pangolin. Together,
mutating multiple signature features and biomarkers delineates the evolutionary
trajectory of mink-origin SARS-CoV-2, leading to the COVID-19 pandemic. Full

2110.10945,2021-11-09,Lewontin (1972),"  Richard C. Lewontin is arguably the most influential evolutionary biologist
of the second half of the 20th century. In this chapter, I provide two windows
on his influential 1972 article ""The Apportionment of Human Diversity"": First,
I show how the fourteen publications that he cites influenced him and framed
his exploration; second, I present close readings of the five sections of the
article: ""Introduction,"" ""The Genes,"" ""The Samples,"" ""The Measure of
Diversity,"" and ""The Results."" I hope to illuminate the article's basic anatomy
and argumentative arc, and why it became such a historically important
document. In particular, I make explicit all of the mathematics (e.g., six
Shannon information measures) and the general population genetic theory
underlying this mathematics (e.g., the Wahlund effect). Lewontin did not make
this explicit in his article. Furthermore, in redoing all of his calculations,
I find that Lewontin made calculation errors (including rounding errors or
omitting diversity component values) for all the genes he analyzed except one
(P), and understated the among races diversity component, according to even
just his own calculations. In reproducing the original computation, I find that
the values of, respectively, within populations, among populations but within
races, and among races diversity apportionments shift slightly (86%, 7%, 7%);
here, in this ""field guide"" to Lewontin (1972), as well as in Winther (2022), I
discuss this change in light of the values produced in subsequent replications
of Lewontin's calculation with other statistics and data sets.

short-term diachronic text mining to a rapidly growing corpus of scientific
publications on COVID-19 captured in the CORD-19 dataset in order to identify
co-occurrences and analyze the behavior of potential candidate treatments. We
used a data set associated with a COVID-19 drug re-purposing study from Oak
Ridge National Laboratory. This study identified existing candidate coronavirus
treatments, including drugs and approved compounds, which had been analyzed and
ranked according to their potential for blocking the ability of the SARS-COV-2
virus to invade human cells. We investigated the occurrence of these candidates
in temporal instances of the CORD-19 corpus. We found that at least 25% of the
identified terms occurred in temporal instances of the corpus to the extent
that their frequency and contextual dynamics could be evaluated. We identified
three classes of behaviors: those where frequency and contextual shifts were
small and positively correlated; those where there was no correlation between
frequency and contextual changes; and those where there was a negative
correlation between frequency and contextual shift. We speculate that the
latter two patterns are indicative that a target candidate therapeutics is
undergoing active evaluation. The patterns we detected demonstrate the
potential benefits of using diachronic text mining techniques with a large
dynamic text corpus to track drug-repurposing activities across international
clinical and laboratory settings.

and variants of concern (VOC) from a single subject (me) over an entire year
post vaccination. After enrolling in the Moderna phase III clinical trial, I
collected my own biological samples pre- and post-immunization in the event of
being a recipient of the experimental vaccine. The evidence strongly supports
the conclusion that I did not receive the placebo. The analysis is admittedly
limited to an n of 1, but the results fit well with data taken from published
works and represent one of the more comprehensive longitudinal evaluations of
vaccine-elicited immunity within a single individual yet to be undertaken.
Though the data amount to a well-documented anecdote, given its granularity, it
is not without its insights and may be of further use in directing future
longitudinal studies that have actual statistical significance.

2111.03445,2024-01-23,Simulation of the behavior of the Leopardus guigna using random walkers,"  Considering that there is very little information on the behavior habits of
guigna cats, as well as investigations in which small populations are captured
to place radiocollars on them and then release them in the place where they
were captured, which is done with the intention of collecting data on their
positions in a territory and thus make estimates of the mean distances they
usually travel. Under the hypothesis that guignas maintain a sedentary behavior
in a specific area of a given territory, this paper shows one way to simulate a
distribution of points in a territory using random walkers to emulate the
distribution of the data that would be obtained by placing radiocollars in a
population of guignas, with which it is possible to make estimates of the mean
distances that move away from a certain fixed position, and the interactions
they can have with points in the territory that represent a high probability of
lethality, such as farms, packs of dogs, roads, urban areas, etc. It is
necessary to mention that by estimating the possible interactions that a
guignas population may have with possible predators in a territory with the
help of a satellite image, it is possible to evaluate the points of a territory
that represent a potentially lethal risk for the guignas, and thus generate
relocation strategies that help preserve them.

2111.04199,2021-11-10,Proteins Evolution Upon Point Mutations,"  The primary aim of this work is to explore how proteins point mutations
impact their marginal stability and, hence, their evolvability. With this
purpose, we show that the use of four classic notions, namely, those from
Leibniz & Kant (1768), Maynard Smith (1970), Einstein & Infeld (1961), and
Anfinsen (1973), is sufficient for a better understanding of the
protein-evolution and, consequently, to determine the factors that could
control it. The preliminary results -- without considering epistasis effects
explicitly -- indicate that the protein marginal-stability change upon point
mutations provides the necessary and sufficient information to describe,
through a Boltzmann factor, the evolution of the amide hydrogen-exchange
protection factors. This finding is of paramount importance because it
illustrates the impact of point mutations on both the protein
marginal-stability and the ensemble of folded conformations coexisting with the
native state and, in the presence of metamorphism, on the propensity for the
appearance of new folds and functions.

2111.06892,2021-11-16,Analysis of chronic diseases progression using stochastic modeling,"  This book handles the fatty liver disease from the bio-statistical point of
view . It discusses the disease process in the simple general form of
health-disease-death multi-states model . Continuous Time Markov Chains are
used to estimate the rate transition matrix utilizing the MLE and Quasi-Newton
formula , once obtained , the probability transition matrix can be estimated by
exponentiation of the rate matrix . The probability transition matrix can also
be obtained by solving the forward Kolmogorov differential equations , which
yields more stable solution than exponentiation of rate matrix. The disease
process is expanded in 9 states model to explain the transition among the
detailed stages of the disease process , in more elaborate form. The
probability transition matrix is used to estimate the number of patients in
each stage , this matrix along with the rate transition matrix , both are used
to estimate life expectancy of patients is each stage. These statistical
indices are of great value as they can help the health policy makers and
medical insurance managers to allocate the resources for investigating and
treating patients in different stages of the disease . This method is of a high
potential value to be used in longitudinal studies conducted by the
pharmaceutical companies to evaluate the effect of anti-fibrotic drugs used to
treat patients within the initial stages of fibrosis . Poisson regression model
is also used to relate the high risk covariates such as type 2 diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia , obesity and hypertension with the rate of progression
and evolution of the stages of the disease over time. The general model , the
expanded model and the model with covariates are illustrated by artificial
hypothetical examples to demonstrate the mathematical statistical indices .

2112.01002,2021-12-03,Attaining scalable storage-expansion dualism for bioartificial tissues,"  The untenable dependence of cryopreservation on cytotoxic cryoprotectants has
motivated the mining of biochemical libraries to identify molecular features
marking cryoprotectants that may prevent ice crystal growth. It is hypothesized
that such molecules may be useful across all temperatures eliminating cellular
destruction due to equilibration cytotoxicity before and after
cryopreservation. By probing the biochemical space using solvation-associated
molecular topology and partition-distribution measures we developed an analytic
formalism for ice crystal inhibition. By probing the union between a heat-shock
protein cluster and an anti-freeze glycoprotein cluster, the model development
process generated distinct regions of interest for anti-freeze glycoprotein and
proved robust across different classes of proteins. These results confirm that
there is a chemical space within which efficacious Ice Crystal Inhibitor
molecular libraries can be constructed. These spaces contain latent projections
drawn from solvent accessibility, hydrogen bonding capacity and molecular
geometry. They also showed that molecular design can be a useful tool in the
development of new-age cryoactive matrices to enable the smooth transition
across culture, preservation and expansion. These chemical spaces provide low
cytotoxicity since such amphipathic molecules occupy a continuum between
solubizing and membrane stabilizing regions as shown by the free energy of
translocation calculations. These biochemical design spaces are fundamentally
the solution to efficient scale-up and deployment of cell therapies.
Consequently, this article proposes the use of a molecular knowledge-mining
approach in the development of a class of non-cytotoxic cryoprotective agents
in the class of Ice Crystal Inhibitor compatible with continuous cryothermic
and normothermic cell storage and expansion.

2112.02592,2021-12-07,A New Rapid Test to End COVID,"  Despite 93.1% to 95.8% of the UK adult population having been vaccinated and
currently 83.5% to 89.8% of adults having received at least two doses (1), and
despite many households testing twice a week with lateral flow tests (2), R at
the time of writing is 0.9 to 1.1, with a growth rate range for England of
between -1% and +1% (3). Furthermore, up to 30% of infected individuals are
going on to experience Long Covid (4). The crisis is far from over and as new
variants of concern like Omicron spread, the situation is not under control,
even in the highly vaccinated and tested UK and far less so in many countries.
The problem is likely to be replicated in other countries with currently low
infection levels as isolation is eased in future, even if these countries reach
a high level of vaccination. Additionally, concerns have been raised about fall
in immunity by 6 months after receiving the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines
(5), and the ability of Omicron to re-infect and cause illness in vaccinated
people, with urgent booster jabs now being given to attempt to mitigate this. A
solution to stop the spread of all variants of COVID-19 is needed now, and we

the evolution of CoV-1 to much more contagious CoV-2, to Omicron, which appears
to be qualitatively different from other recent strains like Delta. Overall the
synchronized dynamics of Omicron is more elaborate than CoV-2 or its variants
like Delta. The surprising result is that while Omicron could be more
contagious than even Delta, it is probably much less dangerous

2112.06923,2021-12-16,Metabolic cascades of energy,"  Life has a special status, it even has its own science: biology. In many
ways, the logic of life seems to differ from that of atoms, molecules, planets,
or any other `inanimate object'. However, life is increasingly measured using
quantities shared by all sciences, like mass, force, energy or power. An
analysis of the dimensions of these quantities provides powerful ways to infer
the relationships they might have with one another. Here we show that a
dimensional analysis of the metabolic laws connecting the characteristic powers
and masses of living organisms offers new ways to understand the deep
connections between the chemistry of microscopic molecules and the physics of
macroscopic objects bound by gravity. This analysis reveals a link between
metabolism and the cascades of energy observed in turbulent flows, opening new
perspectives for both fields.

  Asymmetric Errors","  DNA Data storage has recently attracted much attention due to its durable
preservation and extremely high information density (bits per gram) properties.
In this work, we propose a hybrid coding strategy comprising of generalized
constrained codes to tackle homopolymer (run-length) limit and a protograph
based low-density parity-check (LDPC) code to correct asymmetric nucleotide
level (i.e., A/T/C/G) substitution errors that may occur in the process of DNA
sequencing. Two sequencing techniques namely, Nanopore sequencer and Illumina
sequencer with their equivalent channel models and capacities are analyzed. A
coding architecture is proposed to potentially eliminate the catastrophic
errors caused by the error-propagation in the constrained decoding while
enabling high coding potential. We also show the log likelihood ratio (LLR)
calculation method for the belief propagation decoding with this coding
architecture. The simulation results and the theoretical analysis show that the
proposed coding scheme exhibits good bit-error rate (BER) performance and high
coding potential ($\sim1.98$ bits per nucleotide).
"
2112.12550,2021-12-24,Setting Boundaries for Statistical Mechanics,"  Statistical mechanics has grown without bounds in space. Statistical
mechanics of point particles in an unbounded perfect gas is commonly accepted
as a foundation for understanding many systems, including liquids like the
concentrated salt solutions of life and electrochemical technology, from
batteries to nanodevices. Liquids, however, are not gases. Liquids are filled
with interacting molecules and so the model of a perfect gas is imperfect. Here
we show that statistical mechanics without bounds (in space) is impossible as
well as imperfect, if the molecules interact as charged particles, as nearly
all atoms do. The behavior of charged particles is not defined until boundary
structures and values are defined because charges are governed by the Maxwell
partial differential equations. Partial differential equations require boundary
conditions to be computable or well defined. The Maxwell equations require
boundary conditions on finite sized spatial boundaries (i.e., structures).
Boundary conditions cannot be defined 'at infinity' in a general (i.e., unique)
way because the limiting process that defines infinity includes such a wide
variety of behavior, from light waves that never decay, to fields from dipole
and multipolar charges that decay steeply, to Coulomb fields that decay but not
so steeply. Statistical mechanics involving charges thus involves spatial
boundaries and boundary conditions of finite size. Nearly all matter involves
charges, thus nearly all statistical mechanics requires structures and boundary
conditions on those structures. Boundaries and boundary conditions are not
prominent in classical statistical mechanics. Including boundaries is a
challenge to mathematicians. Statistical mechanics must describe bounded
systems if it is to provide a proper foundation for studying matter.

2112.12791,2021-12-28,"Analysis of animal-related electric outages using species distribution
  models and community science data","  Animal-related outages (AROs) are a prevalent form of outages in electrical
distribution systems. Animal-infrastructure interactions vary across focal
species and regions, underlining the need to study the animal-outage
relationship in more species and diverse systems. Animal activity has been used
as an indicator of reliability in the electrical grid system and to describe
temporal patterns in AROs. However, these ARO models have been limited by a
lack of available estimates of species activity, instead approximating activity
based on seasonal and weather patterns in animal-related outage records and
characteristics of broad taxonomic groups, e.g., squirrels. We highlight
publicly available resources to fill the ecological data gap that is limiting
joint analyses between ecology and energy sectors. Species distribution models
(SDMs), a common technique to model the distribution of a species across
geographic space and time, paired with data sourced from eBird, a community
science database for bird observations, provided us with species-specific
estimates of activity to model spatio-temporal patterns of AROs. These
flexible, species-specific estimates can allow future animal-indicators of grid
reliability to be investigated in more diverse regions and ecological
communities, providing a better understanding of the variation that exists in
animal-outage relationship. AROs were best modeled by accounting for multiple
outage-prone species activity patterns and their unique relationships with
seasonality and habitat availability. Different species were important for
modeling outages in different landscapes and seasons depending on their
distribution and migration behavior. We recommend that future models of AROs
include species-specific activity data that account for the diverse spectrum of
spatio-temporal activity patterns that outage-prone animals exhibit.

  Measurements","  Background: Calculation of the electric field induced by transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the brain requires accurate models of the
stimulation coils. Reconstructing models from the measured magnetic fields of
coils so far worked only for flat coil geometries and required data of their
full magnetic field distribution.
  Objective: To reconstruct models of coils with arbitrary winding geometries
from spatially incomplete magnetic field measurements.
  Methods: Dipole approximation via minimum norm estimation with a cross
validation procedure simultaneously assessing predictability and
reproducibility of the field approximation. The methods were validated on both
simulated and acquired magnetic flux density data. Furthermore, reconstruction
of coil models from sparsely sampled data is investigated and a procedure for
obtaining sparse dipole coil models based on orthogonal matching pursuit is
suggested.
  Results: Given that measured data from regions around the coil are available,
the magnetic vector potential can accurately be represented by fitted dipole
models even from sparsely sampled data. Considerable sparsification of dipole
models is possible while retaining accurate representation of the field also
close to the coil.
  Conclusion: Our versatile approach removes an important hurdle for
constructing coil models from measurement data and enables a flexible trade-off
between the accuracy and computational efficiency of the reconstructed dipole
models.

2201.02055,2022-08-30,A Review of Mathematical and Computational Methods in Cancer Dynamics,"  Cancers are complex adaptive diseases regulated by the nonlinear feedback
systems between genetic instabilities, environmental signals, cellular protein
flows, and gene regulatory networks. Understanding the cybernetics of cancer
requires the integration of information dynamics across multidimensional
spatiotemporal scales, including genetic, transcriptional, metabolic,
proteomic, epigenetic, and multi-cellular networks. However, the time-series
analysis of these complex networks remains vastly absent in cancer research.
With longitudinal screening and time-series analysis of cellular dynamics,
universally observed causal patterns pertaining to dynamical systems, may
self-organize in the signaling or gene expression state-space of cancer
triggering processes. A class of these patterns, strange attractors, may be
mathematical biomarkers of cancer progression. The emergence of intracellular
chaos and chaotic cell population dynamics remains a new paradigm in systems
oncology. As such, chaotic and complex dynamics are discussed as mathematical
hallmarks of cancer cell fate dynamics herein. Given the assumption that
time-resolved single-cell datasets are made available, a survey of
interdisciplinary tools and algorithms from complexity theory, are hereby
reviewed to investigate critical phenomena and chaotic dynamics in cancer
ecosystems. To conclude, the perspective cultivates an intuition for
computational systems oncology in terms of nonlinear dynamics, information
theory, inverse problems and complexity. We highlight the limitations we see in
the area of statistical machine learning but the opportunity at combining it
with the symbolic computational power offered by the mathematical tools
explored.

2201.07879,2022-01-21,On the origins of the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,"  A possible explanation based on first principles for the appearance of the
Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is proposed involving coinfection with
HIV. The gist is that the resultant HIV-induced immunocompromise allows
SARS-CoV-2 greater latitude to explore its own mutational space. This latitude
is not withoutr estriction, and a specific biophysical constraint is explored.
Specifically, a nearly two- to five-fold discrepancy in backbone hydrogen
bonding is observed between sub-molecules in Protein Data Bank files of the
spike glycoprotein yielding two conclusions: mutagenic residues in the
receptor-binding subunit of the spike much more frequently do not participate
in backbone hydrogen bonds; and a technique of viral escape is therefore to
remove such bonds within physico-chemical and functional constraints. Earlier
work, from which the previous discussion is entirely independent, explains
these phenomena from general principles of free energy, namely, the
metastability of the glycoprotein. The conclusions therefore likely hold more
generally as principles in virology.

2201.08176,2022-05-11,"Insights from a computational analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron
  variant: Host-pathogen interaction, pathogenicity and possible therapeutics","  Prominently accountable for the upsurge of COVID-19 cases as the world
attempts to recover from the previous two waves, Omicron has further threatened
the conventional therapeutic approaches. Omicron is the fifth variant of
concern (VOC), which comprises more than 10 mutations in the receptor-binding
domain (RBD) of the spike protein. However, the lack of extensive research
regarding Omicron has raised the need to establish correlations to understand
this variant by structural comparisons. Here, we evaluate, correlate, and
compare its genomic sequences through an immunoinformatic approach with wild
and mutant RBD forms of the spike protein to understand its epidemiological
characteristics and responses towards existing drugs for better patient
management. Our computational analyses provided insights into infectious and
pathogenic trails of the Omicron variant. In addition, while the analysis
represented South Africa's Omicron variant being similar to the
highly-infectious B.1.620 variant, mutations within the prominent proteins are
hypothesized to alter its pathogenicity. Moreover, docking evaluations revealed
significant differences in binding affinity with human receptors, ACE2 and
NRP1. Owing to its characteristics of rendering existing treatments
ineffective, we evaluated the drug efficacy against their target protein
encoded in the Omicron through molecular docking approach. Most of the tested
drugs were proven to be effective. Nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid), MPro 13b, and
Lopinavir displayed increased effectiveness and efficacy, while Ivermectin
showed the best result against Omicron.

2201.11849,2022-01-31,A new Standard DNA damage (SDD) data format,"  Our understanding of radiation induced cellular damage has greatly improved
over the past decades. Despite this progress, there are still many obstacles to
fully understanding how radiation interacts with biologically relevant cellular
components to form observable endpoints. One hurdle is the difficulty faced by
members of different research groups in directly comparing results. Multiple
Monte Carlo codes have been developed to simulate damage induction at the DNA
scale, while at the same time various groups have developed models that
describe DNA repair processes with varying levels of detail. These repair
models are intrinsically linked to the damage model employed in their
development, making it difficult to disentangle systematic effects in either
part of the modelling chain. The modelling chain typically consists of track
structure Monte Carlo simulations of the physics interactions creating direct
damages to the DNA; followed by simulations of the production and initial
reactions of chemical species causing indirect damages. After the DNA damage
induction, DNA repair models combine the simulated damage patterns with
biological models to determine the biological consequences of the damage. We
propose a new Standard data format for DNA Damage to unify the interface
between the simulation of damage induction and the biological modelling of cell
repair processes. Such a standard greatly facilitates inter model comparisons,
providing an ideal environment to tease out model assumptions and identify
persistent, underlying mechanisms. Through inter model comparisons, this
unified standard has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of the
underlying mechanisms of radiation induced DNA damage and the resulting
observable biological effects.

However, with increasing re-use of annotation data, this flexibility has become
an obstacle for standardized downstream processing. Common software packages
that export annotations in GFF3 format model the same data and metadata in
different notations, which puts the burden on end-users to interpret the data
model. The AgBioData consortium is a group of genomics, genetics and breeding
databases and partners working towards shared practices and standards.
Providing concrete guidelines for generating GFF3, and creating a standard
representation of the most common biological data types would provide a major
increase in efficiency for AgBioData databases and the genomics research
community that use the GFF3 format in their daily operations. The AgBioData
GFF3 working group has developed recommendations to solve common problems in
the GFF3 format. We suggest improvements for each of the GFF3 fields, as well
as the special cases of modeling functional annotations, and standard
protein-coding genes. We welcome further discussion of these recommendations.
We request the genomics and bioinformatics community to utilize the github
repository (https://github.com/NAL-i5K/AgBioData_GFF3_recommendation) to
provide feedback via issues or pull requests.

2202.09847,2022-02-22,Evolution and Mutations of Beta 2 Microglobulin,"  Here we examine the evolution of beta-2 microglobulin in terms of its
hydropathic shapes, a theoretical construct that has revealed important trends.
The dynamics of many proteins are largely driven by interactions between the
protein itself and the thin water film that covers it. \b{eta}2m constitutes
the basic building unit of the immunoglobulin superfamily; the evolution of its
amino acid sequences from chickens to mice to humans provides new information
about its multiple functions. Our hydrodynamic method involves concepts of
topological shape evolution towards a critical point for optimized functions.
The results are in excellent agreement with experiment for the details of the
mouse-human evolution, as well as both the dangerous natural amyloid
aggregation mutation D76N, and six other DN test mutations.

  in Oncology","  Quantifying the dynamics of tumor burden reveals useful information about
cancer evolution concerning treatment effects and drug resistance, which play a
crucial role in advancing model-informed drug developments (MIDD) towards
personalized medicine and precision oncology. The emergence of Quantum Machine
Intelligence offers unparalleled insights into tumor dynamics via a quantum
mechanics perspective. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical
neural architecture named $\eta-$Net that enables quantifying quantum dynamics
of tumor burden concerning treatment effects. We evaluate our proposed neural
solution on two major use cases, including cohort-specific and patient-specific
modeling. In silico numerical results show a high capacity and expressivity of
$\eta-$Net to the quantified biological problem. Moreover, the close connection
to representation learning - the foundation for successes of modern AI, enables
efficient transferability of empirical knowledge from relevant cohorts to
targeted patients. Finally, we leverage Bayesian optimization to quantify the
epistemic uncertainty of model predictions, paving the way for $\eta-$Net
towards reliable AI in decision-making for clinical usages.
"
2203.05174,2022-08-30,Assessing Phenotype Definitions for Algorithmic Fairness,"  Disease identification is a core, routine activity in observational health
research. Cohorts impact downstream analyses, such as how a condition is
characterized, how patient risk is defined, and what treatments are studied. It
is thus critical to ensure that selected cohorts are representative of all
patients, independently of their demographics or social determinants of health.
While there are multiple potential sources of bias when constructing phenotype
definitions which may affect their fairness, it is not standard in the field of
phenotyping to consider the impact of different definitions across subgroups of
patients. In this paper, we propose a set of best practices to assess the
fairness of phenotype definitions. We leverage established fairness metrics
commonly used in predictive models and relate them to commonly used
epidemiological cohort description metrics. We describe an empirical study for
Crohn's disease and diabetes type 2, each with multiple phenotype definitions
taken from the literature across two sets of patient subgroups (gender and
race). We show that the different phenotype definitions exhibit widely varying
and disparate performance according to the different fairness metrics and
subgroups. We hope that the proposed best practices can help in constructing
fair and inclusive phenotype definitions.

neurological and vascular health. Data on the vitamin K content of Australian
foods are limited, preventing estimation of vitamin K intakes in the Australian
population. We measured phylloquinone (PK) and menaquinone (MK) -4 to -10 in
cheese, yoghurt and meat products (48 composite samples from 288 primary
samples) by liquid chromatography with electrospray ionisation-tandem mass
spectrometry. At least one K vitamer was found in every sample. The greatest
mean concentrations of PK, MK-4 and MK-9 were found in lamb liver, chicken leg
meat and Cheddar cheese, respectively. Cheddar cheese and cream cheese
contained MK-5. MK-8 was found in Cheddar cheese only. As the K vitamer profile
and concentrations appear to vary considerably by geographical location,
Australia needs a vitamin K food composition dataset that is representative of
foods consumed in Australia.

2203.13193,2022-03-25,"Modeling-informed policy, policy evaluated by modeling: Evolution of
  mathematical epidemiology in the context of society and economy","  The COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has had the world in
its grip from the beginning of 2020, has resulted in an unprecedented level of
public interest and media attention on the field of mathematical epidemiology.
Ever since the disease came to worldwide attention, numerous models with
varying levels of sophistication have been proposed; many of these have tried
to predict the course of the disease over different time-scales. Other models
have examined the efficacy of various policy measures that have been adopted
(including the unparalleled use of ""lockdowns"") to contain and combat the
disease. This multiplicity of models may have led to bewilderment in many
quarters about the true capabilities and utility of mathematical modeling. Here
we provide a brief guide to epidemiological modeling, focusing on how it has
emerged as a tool for informed public-health policy-making and has in turn,
influenced the design of interventions aimed at preventing disease outbreaks
from turning into raging epidemics. We show that the diversity of models is
somewhat illusory, as the bulk of them are rooted in the compartmental modeling
framework that we describe here. While their basic structure may appear to be a
highly idealized description of the processes at work, we show that features
that provide more realism, such as the community organization of populations or
strategic decision-making by individuals, can be incorporated into such models.
We conclude with the argument that the true value of models lies in their
ability to test in silico the consequences of different policy choices in the
course of an epidemic, a much superior alternative to trial-and-error
approaches that are highly costly in terms of both lives and socio-economic
disruption.

2203.14130,2022-09-14,Energy cost of dynamical stabilization: stored versus dissipated energy,"  Dynamical stabilization processes (homeostasis) are ubiquitous in nature, but
energetic resources needed for their existence were not studied systematically.
Here we undertake such a study using the famous model of Kapitza's pendulum,
which attracted attention in the context of classical and quantum control. This
model is generalized and made autonomous. We show that friction and stored
energy stabilize the upper (normally unstable) state of the pendulum. The upper
state can be made asymptotically stable and yet it does not cost any constant
dissipation of energy, only a transient energy dissipation is needed. The
asymptotic stability under a single perturbation does not imply stability with
respect to multiple perturbations. For a range of pendulum-controller
interactions, there is also a regime where constant energy dissipation is
needed for stabilization. Several mechanisms are studied for the decay of
dynamically stabilized states.

2203.14201,2022-03-31,"Cryopreservation of seeds of blue waterlily (Nymphaea caerulea) using
  glutathione adding plant vitrification solution, PVS+","  Nymphaea caerulea is a valuable freshwater aquatic plant, not only because of
its ornamental value but also its extractions for chemical and medical uses. It
is necessary to store its seeds as backup resources. Cryopreservation is the
reliable, cost-effective method for long-term preservation of botanical genetic
banks, especially for recalcitrant plants. In this study, we demonstrated that
due to unable to tolerate desiccation and low-temperature, N. caerulea is
recalcitrant. Since viability was lost before 6 months storage, N. caerulea
seeds were not appropriate to long-term store by traditional storage method.
The only way to long-term store N. caerulea seeds is cryopreservation. However,
Plant Vitrification Solution 3 (PVS3; 50% w/v sucrose, 50% w/v glycerol), a
commonly used plant vitrification solution, was ineffective on N. caerulea
seeds cryopreservation. The maximum survival rate of cryopreserved seeds
treated by PVS3 was only 23%. Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen
species (ROS) accumulation within seeds was the reason to cause inefficiency of
PVS3 treated seeds cryopreservation. We developed a new plant vitrification
solution (PVS+), by adding glutathione (GSH) into PVS3. PVS+ rescued the
inefficiency by decreasing ROS accumulation and elevated survival rate of
cryopreserved seeds to 97%. Our results showed some inefficiencies of plant
tissue cryopreservation may be caused by ROS-induced oxidative stress.
Antioxidants can reduce ROS-induced oxidative stress and improve seeds survival
after cryopreservation. In conclusion, N. caerulea seeds were identified as
recalcitrant and successfully cryopreserved. Suppressing ROS accumulation
during cryopreservation may be a potential strategy to improve survival rate of
recalcitrant seeds after cryopreservation.

2204.03653,2022-05-20,Embedding of Functional Human Brain Networks on a Sphere,"  Human brain activity is often measured using the blood-oxygen-level dependent
(BOLD) signals obtained through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
The strength of connectivity between brain regions is then measured as a
Pearson correlation matrix. As the number of brain regions increases, the
dimension of matrix increases. It becomes extremely cumbersome to even
visualize and quantify such weighted complete networks. To remedy the problem,
we propose to embed brain networks onto a sphere, which is a Riemannian
manifold with constant positive curvature. The Matlab code for the spherical
embedding is given in https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/sphericalMDS.

broilers. The first three, up to 14d and without specific challenges, tested
the effects on intestinal histology, skeletal integrity, and growth. Other two
experiments, up to 28d birds were challenged to induce feed passage syndrome
(STR) and test the effect on the antioxidant status and performance,
contrasting later the results under a natural challenge in commercial

with coccidia were tested to determine the effects on coccidiosis, nutrient
digestibility, and feed efficiency (FCR). Corn-soybean-fish meal diets were
used. Under healthy conditions, PRO effects were observed on intestinal villus
height and surface area, mucosa density and structure, villus to crypt ratio,
goblet cells density, mucus production, body weight gain, and FCR (P<0.04), and
carcass yield and bone density (P<0.08). Birds affected by STR showed effects
(P<0.05) on superoxide dismutase activity, bodyweight gain, FCRE, non-normal

coccidia showed effects on cocci-positive ratio, cocci microscopic score,
oocysts count, bursal diameter, body weight gain, FCR, apparent digestibility
of dry matter and crude protein, protein and energy efficiencies (P<0.01), and

2204.09099,2022-12-20,A Maximum Entropy Approach to Defining Cell State,"  The past few decades have seen great leaps in technologies to analyze cells
and tissues. Omics methods in particular now allow us unprecedented access to
their the molecular composition where the base-level resolution of transcripts
and their numbers can be determined at a single cell level. Existing methods to
analyze the resulting data make use of the count data while discarding the
information present in the sequences themselves. In this paper we used a
maximum entropy approach to develop a method to analyze RNA-seq data using both
the sequence and count information. By mapping sequences to vectors of spins
and defining an energy function on them, we were able to identify specific
states in a biological process using mean energies and their associated
Boltzmann-probabilities. This approach opens up new avenues in the quantitative
analysis of -omics data and analysis of biological function.
"
2204.09378,2024-09-30,Biocosmology: Towards the birth of a new science,"  Cosmologists wish to explain how our Universe, in all its complexity, could
ever have come about. For that, we assess the number of states in our Universe
now. This plays the role of entropy in thermodynamics of the Universe, and
reveals the magnitude of the problem of initial conditions to be solved. The
usual budgeting accounts for gravity, thermal motions, and finally the vacuum
energy whose entropy, given by the Bekenstein bound, dominates the entropy
budget today. There is however one number which we have not accounted for: the
number of states in our complex biosphere. What is the entropy of life and is
it sizeable enough to need to be accounted for at the Big Bang? Building on
emerging ideas within theoretical biology, we show that the configuration space
of living systems, unlike that of their fundamental physics counterparts, can
grow rapidly in response to emerging biological complexity. A model for this
expansion is provided through combinatorial innovation by the Theory of the
Adjacent Possible (TAP) and its corresponding TAP equation, whose solutions we
investigate, confirming the possibility of rapid state-pace growth. While the
results of this work remain far from being firmly established, the evidence we
provide is many-fold and strong. The implications are far-reaching, and open a
variety of lines for future investigation, a new scientific field we term
biocosmology. In particular the relationship between the information content in
life and the information content in the Universe may need to be rebuilt from
scratch.

2204.09673,2022-05-26,Guidelines for reporting cell types: the MIRACL standard,"  Cell types are at the root of modern biology, and describing them is a core
task of the Human Cell Atlas project. Surprisingly, there are no standards for
reporting new cell types, leading to a gap between classes mentioned in
biomedical literature and the Cell Ontology, the primary registry of cell
types. Here we introduce the Minimal Information Reporting About a CelL
(MIRACL) standard, a guideline for describing cell types alongside scientific
articles. In a MIRACL sheet, authors organize a label, a diagnostic
description, a taxon, an anatomical structure, and a parent cell class for each
cell type of interest. The MIRACL standard bridges the gap between wet-lab
researchers and ontologists, facilitating the integration of biomedical
knowledge into ontologies and artificial intelligence systems.

2204.09680,2022-09-13,"Emergent simulation of cell-like shapes satisfying the conditions of
  life using lattice-type multiset chemical model","  One of the great challenges in science is determining when, where, why, and
how life first arose as well as the form taken by this life. In the present
study, life was assumed to be (1) bounded, (2) replicating, (3) able to inherit
information, and (4) able to metabolize energy. The various existing hypotheses
provide little explanation of how these four conditions for life were
established. Indeed, 'how' a chemical process that simultaneously satisfies all
four conditions emerged after the materials for life were in place is not
always clear. In this study, a 'multiset chemical lattice model', which allows
virtual molecules of multiple types to be placed in each cell on a
two-dimensional space, was considered. Using only the processes of molecular
diffusion, reaction, and polymerization and modeling the chemical reactions of
15 types of molecules and 2 types of polymerized molecules and using the
morphogenesis rule of the Turing model, the process of emergence of a cell-like
form with the four conditions of life was modeled and demonstrated. Thus, in
future research, this model will allow us to revisit and refine each of the
hypotheses for the emergence of life.

2204.10672,2022-04-25,"A systematic review of guidelines for the use of race, ethnicity, and
  ancestry reveals widespread consensus but also points of ongoing disagreement","  The use of population descriptors like race, ethnicity, and ancestry in
science, medicine and public health has a long, complicated, and at times dark
history, particularly for genetics, given the field's perceived importance for
understanding between-group differences. The historical and potential harms
that come with irresponsible use of these categories suggests a clear need for
definitive guidance about when and how they can be used appropriately. However,
while many prior authors have provided such guidance, no established consensus
exists, and the extant literature has not been examined for implied consensus
and sources of disagreement. Here we present the results of a systematic review
of published normative recommendations regarding the use of population
categories, particularly in genetics research. Following PRISMA guidelines, we
extracted recommendations from n=121 articles matching inclusion criteria.
Articles were published consistently throughout the time period examined and in
a broad range of journals, demonstrating an ongoing and interdisciplinary
perceived need for guidance. Examined recommendations fall under one of eight
themes identified during analysis. Seven are characterized by broad agreement
across articles; one, Appropriate definitions of population categories and
contexts for use, revealed substantial fundamental disagreement among articles.
While many articles focus on the inappropriate use of race, none fundamentally
problematize ancestry. This work can be a resource to researchers looking for
normative guidance on the use of population descriptors, and can orient authors
of future guidelines to this complex field, contributing to the development of
more effective future guidelines for genetics research.

2204.11716,2022-08-25,Masked Image Modeling Advances 3D Medical Image Analysis,"  Recently, masked image modeling (MIM) has gained considerable attention due
to its capacity to learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data and has been
demonstrated to be effective on a wide variety of vision tasks involving
natural images. Meanwhile, the potential of self-supervised learning in
modeling 3D medical images is anticipated to be immense due to the high
quantities of unlabeled images, and the expense and difficulty of quality
labels. However, MIM's applicability to medical images remains uncertain. In
this paper, we demonstrate that masked image modeling approaches can also
advance 3D medical images analysis in addition to natural images. We study how
masked image modeling strategies leverage performance from the viewpoints of 3D
medical image segmentation as a representative downstream task: i) when
compared to naive contrastive learning, masked image modeling approaches
accelerate the convergence of supervised training even faster (1.40$\times$)
and ultimately produce a higher dice score; ii) predicting raw voxel values
with a high masking ratio and a relatively smaller patch size is non-trivial
self-supervised pretext-task for medical images modeling; iii) a lightweight
decoder or projection head design for reconstruction is powerful for masked
image modeling on 3D medical images which speeds up training and reduce cost;
iv) finally, we also investigate the effectiveness of MIM methods under
different practical scenarios where different image resolutions and labeled
data ratios are applied.

2205.00027,2022-05-03,"Mind the gap: how multiracial individuals get left behind when we talk
  about race, ethnicity, and ancestry in genomic research","  It is widely acknowledged that there is a diversity problem in genomics
stemming from the vast underrepresentation of non-European genetic ancestry
populations. While many challenges exist to address this gap, a major
complicating factor is the misalignment between (1) how society defines and
labels individuals; (2) how populations are defined for research; and (3) how
research findings are translated to benefit human health. Recent conversations
to address the lack of clarity in terminology in genomics have largely focused
on ontologies that acknowledge the difference between genetic ancestry and
race. Yet, these ontological frameworks for ancestry often follow the
subjective discretization of people, normalized by historical racial
categories; this perpetuates exclusion at the expense of inclusion. In order to
make the benefits of genomics research accessible to all, standards around
race, ethnicity, and genetic ancestry must deliberately and explicitly address
multiracial, genetically admixed individuals who make salient the limitations
of discrete categorization in genomics and society. Starting with the need to
clarify terminology, we outline current practices in genomic research and
translation that fail those who are 'binned' for failing to fit into a specific
bin. We conclude by offering concrete solutions for future research in order to
share the benefits of genomics research with the full human population.

2205.02844,2022-09-02,"Transcripts per million ratio: applying distribution-aware normalisation
  over the popular TPM method","  Current popular methods in literature of RNA sequencing normalisation do not
account for gene length when compared across samples, whilst adjusting for
count biases in the data. This creates a gap in the normalisation as bigger
genes in RNA sequencing accumulate more reads due to shotgun sequencing
methods. As a result, the proportions of these reads inter-sample are not
properly accounted for in current normalisation methods. Alternatively, methods
which account for gene length do not account for the pan-sample biases in the
data by accounting for a central read average. Thus, in order to fill in the
gap in the literature, we propose a novel method of Transcripts Per Million
Ratio and its relatives in RNA-sequencing differential expression normalisation
that can be used in different conditions, which takes into account the gene
length as well as relative expression in normalisation.

2205.04060,2024-01-04,"Approaches to the classification of complex systems: Words, texts, and
  more","  The Chapter starts with introductory information about quantitative
linguistics notions, like rank--frequency dependence, Zipf's law, frequency
spectra, etc. Similarities in distributions of words in texts with level
occupation in quantum ensembles hint at a superficial analogy with statistical
physics. This enables one to define various parameters for texts based on this
physical analogy, including ""temperature"", ""chemical potential"", entropy, and
some others. Such parameters provide a set of variables to classify texts
serving as an example of complex systems. Moreover, texts are perhaps the
easiest complex systems to collect and analyze.
  Similar approaches can be developed to study, for instance, genomes due to
well-known linguistic analogies. We consider a couple of approaches to define
nucleotide sequences in mitochondrial DNAs and viral RNAs and demonstrate their
possible application as an auxiliary tool for comparative analysis of genomes.
  Finally, we discuss entropy as one of the parameters, which can be easily
computed from rank--frequency dependences. Being a discriminating parameter in
some problems of classification of complex systems, entropy can be given a
proper interpretation only in a limited class of problems. Its overall role and
significance remain an open issue so far.

  in the neurosciences","  Over the last three decades, the human brain, and its role in determining
behavior have been receiving a growing amount of attention in academia as well
as in society more generally. Neuroscientific explanations of human behavior or
other phenomena are often especially appealing to lay people. Therefore,
neuroscientific explanations that can affect individuals, groups, or social
relations in general should be formulated in a careful and responsible way. One
field in which especially feminist scholars request more caution is the
neuroscientific examination of sex or gender differences. Feminist scholars
have described various ways in which sexist bias might be present in
neuroscientific research on sex or gender differences. In this context, they
coined the term ""neurosexism"" to describe the entanglement between
neuroscientific work and sexist ideology, and ""neurofeminism"" as a response to
that. Here, we aim to give an overview over the contemporary neurofeminist
literature. In the first part, common levels of analysis in the neurofeminist
literature are presented and the research level is explored in more detail. In
the second part, some common developments in more recent neurofeminist
scholarship are discussed. For this, we review recent publications with the aim
to provide neuroscientists with a solid understanding of neurofeminist
criticism so that they may evaluate neuroscientific claims about on sex or
gender differences from this critical perspective.

2205.07921,2023-10-17,The Futility of Exoplanet Biosignatures,"  The ultimate goal of astrobiology is to determine the distribution and
diversity of life in the universe. But as the word ""biosignature"" suggests,
what will be detected is not life itself, but an observation implicating a
particular process associated with living systems. Technical constraints and
our limited access to other worlds suggest we are more likely to detect an
out-of-equilibrium suite of gasses than a writhing octopus. Yet, anything short
of a writhing octopus will raise skepticism among astrobiologists about what
has been detected. Resolving that skepticism requires a theory to delineate
processes due to life and those due solely to abiotic mechanisms. This poses an
existential question for the endeavor of life detection: How do astrobiologists
plan to detect life via features shared between non-living and living systems?
We argue that you cannot without an underlying theory of life. We illustrate
this by analyzing the hypothetical detection of an ""Earth 2.0"" exoplanet. In
the absence of a theory of life, we argue the community should focus on
identifying unambiguous features of life via four areas of active research:
understanding the principles of life on Earth, building life in the lab,
detecting life in the solar system and searching for technosignatures.
Ultimately, we ask, what exactly do astrobiologists hope to learn by searching
for life?

2206.03555,2022-06-09,"A generative recommender system with GMM prior for cancer drug
  generation and sensitivity prediction","  Recent emergence of high-throughput drug screening assays sparkled an
intensive development of machine learning methods, including models for
prediction of sensitivity of cancer cell lines to anti-cancer drugs, as well as
methods for generation of potential drug candidates. However, a concept of
generation of compounds with specific properties and simultaneous modeling of
their efficacy against cancer cell lines has not been comprehensively explored.
To address this need, we present VADEERS, a Variational Autoencoder-based Drug
Efficacy Estimation Recommender System. The generation of compounds is
performed by a novel variational autoencoder with a semi-supervised Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM) prior. The prior defines a clustering in the latent space,
where the clusters are associated with specific drug properties. In addition,
VADEERS is equipped with a cell line autoencoder and a sensitivity prediction
network. The model combines data for SMILES string representations of
anti-cancer drugs, their inhibition profiles against a panel of protein
kinases, cell lines biological features and measurements of the sensitivity of
the cell lines to the drugs. The evaluated variants of VADEERS achieve a high
r=0.87 Pearson correlation between true and predicted drug sensitivity
estimates. We train the GMM prior in such a way that the clusters in the latent
space correspond to a pre-computed clustering of the drugs by their inhibitory
profiles. We show that the learned latent representations and new generated
data points accurately reflect the given clustering. In summary, VADEERS offers
a comprehensive model of drugs and cell lines properties and relationships
between them, as well as a guided generation of novel compounds.

2207.03540,2022-07-11,Data integration in systems genetics and aging research,"  Human life expectancy has dramatically improved over the course of the last
century. Although this reflects a global improvement in sanitation and medical
care, this also implies that more people suffer from diseases that typically
manifest later in life, like Alzheimer and atherosclerosis. Increasing
healthspan by delaying or reverting the development of these age-related
diseases has therefore become an urgent challenge in biomedical research.
Research in this field is complicated by the multi-factorial nature of
age-related diseases. They are rooted in complex physiological mechanisms
impacted by heritable, environment and life-style factors that can be unique to
each individual. Although technological advances in high-throughput
biomolecular assays have enabled researchers to investigate individual
physiology at the molecular level, integrating information about its different
components, and accounting for individual variations remains a challenge. We
are using a large collection of omics and phenotype data derived from the BXD
mouse genetic diversity panel to explore how good data management practices, as
fostered by the FAIR principles, paired with an explainable artificial
intelligence framework, can provide solutions to decipher the complex roots of
age-related diseases. These developments will help to propose innovative
approaches to extend healthspan in the aging global population.

will allow researchers to find existing resources that are relevant for sharing
sensitive data across all participating research infrastructures (F in FAIR).
The toolbox will provide links to recommendations, procedures, and best
practices, as well as to software (tools) to support data sharing and reuse. It
will be based upon a tagging (categorisation) system, allowing consistent

  variants of concern during COVID-19","  Due to the high mutation rate of the virus, the COVID-19 pandemic evolved
rapidly. Certain variants of the virus, such as Delta and Omicron, emerged with
altered viral properties leading to severe transmission and death rates. These
variants burdened the medical systems worldwide with a major impact to travel,
productivity, and the world economy. Unsupervised machine learning methods have
the ability to compress, characterize, and visualize unlabelled data. This
paper presents a framework that utilizes unsupervised machine learning methods
to discriminate and visualize the associations between major COVID-19 variants
based on their genome sequences. These methods comprise a combination of
selected dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques. The framework
processes the RNA sequences by performing a k-mer analysis on the data and
further visualises and compares the results using selected dimensionality
reduction methods that include principal component analysis (PCA),
t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE), and uniform manifold
approximation projection (UMAP). Our framework also employs agglomerative
hierarchical clustering to visualize the mutational differences among major
variants of concern and country-wise mutational differences for selected
variants (Delta and Omicron) using dendrograms. We also provide country-wise
mutational differences for selected variants via dendrograms. We find that the
proposed framework can effectively distinguish between the major variants and
has the potential to identify emerging variants in the future.

2208.03193,2023-02-22,Did Maxwell dream of electrical bacteria?,"  We propose a model for bacterial Quorum Sensing based on an auxiliary
electrostatic-like interac-tion originating from a fictitious electrical charge
that represents bacteria activity. A cooperative mechanism for charge/activity
exchange is introduced to implement chemotaxis and replication. The bacteria
system is thus represented by means of a complex resistor network where link
re-sistances take into account the allowed activity-flow among individuals. By
explicit spatial sto-chastic simulations, we show that the model exhibits
different quasi-realistic behaviors from colo-ny formation to biofilm
aggregation. The electrical signal associated with Quorum Sensing is ana-lyzed
in space and time and provides useful information about the colony dynamics. In
particular, we analyze the transition between the planktonic and the colony
phases as the intensity of Quorum Sensing is varied.

2208.04236,2022-08-09,"A Comparison Study of the Detection Limit of Omicron SARS-CoV-2
  Nucleocapsid by various Rapid Antigen Tests","  Since the first case of COVID-19 disease in Wuhan in December 2019, there is
a worldwide struggle to reduce the transmission of acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Many countries worldwide decided to impose local
lockdowns in order to reduce person-to-person interactions, masks became
obligatory especially in closed spaces, and there was a general requirement for
social distance. However, the most efficient method to reduce continuing
spreading of infection among the population, and in the meantime maintain a
regular daily life, is early detection of infected contagious people. Up to
now, the most reliable method for SARS-CoV-2 detection is reverse-transcriptase
PCR test (RT-PCR). It is possible to detect the virus even if there is only one
RNA strand in the sample, and run hundreds of samples simultaneously. This
method has a few disadvantages, such as high cost, is time consuming, the need
for medical laboratories and skilled staff to perform the test, and the major
flaw: the lack of appropriate number of available tests. The latterly prominent
Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) and its derivatives have caused a tremendous
increase in the number of infected people due to its enhanced transmissibility.
This all emphasizes the high demand for easy-to-use, cheap and available
detection tests.

  Contagiousness Evolution","  In 2022 new subvariants of Coronavirus appeared in South Africa, and spread
rapidly to other parts of the world. The effects of selective evolution on
increasing the already high contagiousness of CoV19 up to Omicron were
previously discussed with high accuracy using concepts new to molecular biology

2208.08907,2023-05-02,Application of Traditional Vaccine Development Strategies to SARS-CoV-2,"  Over the past 150 years, vaccines have revolutionized the relationship
between people and disease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, technologies such as
mRNA vaccines have received attention due to their novelty and successes.
However, more traditional vaccine development platforms have also yielded
important tools in the worldwide fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A variety
of approaches have been used to develop COVID-19 vaccines that are now
authorized for use in countries around the world. In this review, we highlight
strategies that focus on the viral capsid and outwards, rather than on the
nucleic acids inside. These approaches fall into two broad categories:
whole-virus vaccines and subunit vaccines. Whole-virus vaccines use the virus
itself, either in an inactivated or attenuated state. Subunit vaccines contain
instead an isolated, immunogenic component of the virus. Here, we highlight
vaccine candidates that apply these approaches against SARS-CoV-2 in different
ways. In a companion manuscript, we review the more recent and novel
development of nucleic-acid based vaccine technologies. We further consider the
role that these COVID-19 vaccine development programs have played in
prophylaxis at the global scale. Well-established vaccine technologies have
proved especially important to making vaccines accessible in low- and
middle-income countries. Vaccine development programs that use established
platforms have been undertaken in a much wider range of countries than those
using nucleic-acid-based technologies, which have been led by wealthy Western
countries. Therefore, these vaccine platforms, though less novel from a
biotechnological standpoint, have proven to be extremely important to the
management of SARS-CoV-2.

2208.11145,2022-11-28,"Collective targeted migrations: a balancing act involving aggregation,
  group size and environmental clues: a simulation study","  What is behind the \emph{wisdom of the crowds} described by Simons (2004)? It
has been showed that insects may use gravitational fields to travel (Dreyer et
al 2018) and we may ask whether the use of gravitational fields is enough to
secure the arrival of an individual to a relatively narrow spot thousands of
kilometers away, as it is the case for example of monarch butterflies, which
may travel 4,500 km to land in Mexico within an area of about 1/8 the size of
Long Island. Here we show that if individuals budget a fraction of time to seek
the target and the rest to maintain aggregation, the chances of landing within
a narrow spot even under a weak signal are increased. Our model exhibits the
existence of an equilibrium, the tradeoff that comes from maintaining group
size, aggregation, and targeting. Whenever this balance is broken, the
population may behave erratically. If this strategic balance between targeting
and aggregation is prevalent then the possibility of destabilizing may be used
to control or regulate the spread of undesirable organisms that navigate under
this balancing set of mechanisms.

2208.12298,2022-08-29,"Nonextensive realizations in interacting ion channels: implications for
  mechano-electrical transducer mechanisms","  Although there are theoretical studies on the thermodynamics of ion channels,
an investigation involving the thermodynamics of coupled channels has not been
proposed. To overcome this issue, we developed calculations to present a
thermodynamic scenario associated with mechanoelectrical transduction channels
as a single and coupling of two-state channels. The modeling was inspired by
the Tsallis theory, in which we derived the open and closed probability
distributions, the joint probability distribution, the Tsallis entropy, and the
Shannon mutual information. Despite being well studied in many biological
systems, the literature has not addressed both entropy and mutual information
related to isolated and a pair of physically interacting mechanoelectrical
transduction channels. Inspired by the hair cell biophysics, we revealed how
the presence of nonextensivity modulates the degree of entropy and mutual
information as a function of stereocilia displacements. In this sense, we
showed how the non-extensivity regulates the current versus displacement curve
for a single and two interacting channels made up of a single open and closed
states. Overall, subadditivity and superadditivity yielded increments and
decrements in the entropy and mutual information compared with the extensive
regime. We also observed that the magnitude of the interaction between the two
channels significantly influences the amplitude of the joint entropy and the
mutual information. These results are directly related to the modulation of the
channel kinetics, given by changes evoked by hair cell displacements. Finally,
we found that the gating force modulates the contribution of subadditivity and
superadditivity present in the joint entropy and the mutual information. The
present findings shed light on the thermodynamic process involved in the
molecular mechanisms of the auditory system.

2209.00693,2022-09-29,A large dataset of software mentions in the biomedical literature,"  We describe the CZ Software Mentions dataset, a new dataset of software
mentions in biomedical papers. Plain-text software mentions are extracted with
a trained SciBERT model from several sources: the NIH PubMed Central collection
and from papers provided by various publishers to the Chan Zuckerberg
Initiative. The dataset provides sources, context and metadata, and, for a
number of mentions, the disambiguated software entities and links. We extract
1.12 million unique string software mentions from 2.4 million papers in the NIH
PMC-OA Commercial subset, 481k unique mentions from the NIH PMC-OA
Non-Commercial subset (both gathered in October 2021) and 934k unique mentions
from 3 million papers in the Publishers' collection. There is variation in how
software is mentioned in papers and extracted by the NER algorithm. We propose
a clustering-based disambiguation algorithm to map plain-text software mentions
into distinct software entities and apply it on the NIH PubMed Central
Commercial collection. Through this methodology, we disambiguate 1.12 million
unique strings extracted by the NER model into 97600 unique software entities,
covering 78% of all software-paper links. We link 185000 of the mentions to a
repository, covering about 55% of all software-paper links. We describe in
detail the process of building the datasets, disambiguating and linking the
software mentions, as well as opportunities and challenges that come with a
dataset of this size. We make all data and code publicly available as a new
resource to help assess the impact of software (in particular scientific open
source projects) on science.

2209.05097,2022-09-13,Reproducibility in machine learning for medical imaging,"  Reproducibility is a cornerstone of science, as the replication of findings
is the process through which they become knowledge. It is widely considered
that many fields of science are undergoing a reproducibility crisis. This has
led to the publications of various guidelines in order to improve research
reproducibility.
  This didactic chapter intends at being an introduction to reproducibility for
researchers in the field of machine learning for medical imaging. We first
distinguish between different types of reproducibility. For each of them, we
aim at defining it, at describing the requirements to achieve it and at
discussing its utility. The chapter ends with a discussion on the benefits of
reproducibility and with a plea for a non-dogmatic approach to this concept and
its implementation in research practice.

2209.06265,2022-09-15,"Automated detection of pronunciation errors in non-native English speech
  employing deep learning","  Despite significant advances in recent years, the existing Computer-Assisted
Pronunciation Training (CAPT) methods detect pronunciation errors with a
relatively low accuracy (precision of 60% at 40%-80% recall). This Ph.D. work
proposes novel deep learning methods for detecting pronunciation errors in
non-native (L2) English speech, outperforming the state-of-the-art method in
AUC metric (Area under the Curve) by 41%, i.e., from 0.528 to 0.749. One of the
problems with existing CAPT methods is the low availability of annotated
mispronounced speech needed for reliable training of pronunciation error
detection models. Therefore, the detection of pronunciation errors is
reformulated to the task of generating synthetic mispronounced speech.
Intuitively, if we could mimic mispronounced speech and produce any amount of
training data, detecting pronunciation errors would be more effective.
Furthermore, to eliminate the need to align canonical and recognized phonemes,
a novel end-to-end multi-task technique to directly detect pronunciation errors
was proposed. The pronunciation error detection models have been used at Amazon
to automatically detect pronunciation errors in synthetic speech to accelerate
the research into new speech synthesis methods. It was demonstrated that the
proposed deep learning methods are applicable in the tasks of detecting and
reconstructing dysarthric speech.

2209.12624,2022-09-27,An Artificial Intelligence Outlook for Colorectal Cancer Screening,"  Colorectal cancer is the third most common tumor in men and the second in
women, accounting for 10% of all tumors worldwide. It ranks second in
cancer-related deaths with 9.4%, following lung cancer. The decrease in
mortality rate documented over the last 20 years has shown signs of slowing
down since 2017, necessitating concentrated actions on specific measures that
have exhibited considerable potential. As such, the technical foundation and
research evidence for blood-derived protein markers have been set, pending
comparative validation, clinical implementation and integration into an
artificial intelligence enabled decision support framework that also considers
knowledge on risk factors. The current paper aspires to constitute the driving
force for creating change in colorectal cancer screening by reviewing existing
medical practices through accessible and non-invasive risk estimation,
employing a straightforward artificial intelligence outlook.

2209.14297,2024-10-25,"Using Multivariate Linear Regression for Biochemical Oxygen Demand
  Prediction in Waste Water","  There exist opportunities for Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR) in the
prediction of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) in waste water, using the diverse
water quality parameters as the input variables. The goal of this work is to
examine the capability of MLR in prediction of BOD in waste water through four
input variables: Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Nitrogen, Fecal Coliform and Total
Coliform. The four input variables have higher correlation strength to BOD out
of the seven parameters examined for the strength of correlation. Machine
Learning (ML) was done with both 80% and 90% of the data as the training set
and 20% and 10% as the test set respectively. MLR performance was evaluated
through the coefficient of correlation (r), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and
the percentage accuracy in prediction of BOD. The performance indices for the
input variables of Dissolved Oxygen, Nitrogen, Fecal Coliform and Total
Coliform in prediction of BOD are: RMSE=6.77mg/L, r=0.60 and accuracy 70.3% for
training dataset of 80% and RMSE=6.74mg/L, r=0.60 and accuracy of 87.5% for
training set of 90% of the dataset. It was found that increasing the percentage
of the training set above 80% of the dataset improved the accuracy of the model
only but did not have a significant impact on the prediction capacity of the
model. The results showed that MLR model could be successfully employed in the
estimation of BOD in waste water using appropriately selected input parameters.

and control of bioprocesses. For each topic, we will highlight successful
application cases, current challenges and point out domains that can
potentially benefit from technology transfer and further progress in the field
of ML.

2210.02593,2022-10-07,"Be Prospective, Not Retrospective: A Philosophy for Advancing
  Reproducibility in Modern Biological Research","  The ubiquity of computation in modern scientific research inflicts new
challenges for reproducibility. While most journals now require code and data
be made available, the standards for organization, annotation, and validation
remain lax, making the data and code often difficult to decipher or practically
use. I believe that this is due to the documentation, collation, and validation
of code and data only being done in retrospect. In this essay, I reflect on my
experience contending with these challenges and present a philosophy for
prioritizing reproducibility in modern biological research where balancing
computational analysis and wet-lab experiments is commonplace. Modern tools
used in scientific workflows (such as GitHub repositories) lend themselves well
to this philosophy where reproducibility begins at project inception, not
completion. To that end, I present and provide a programming-language agnostic
template architecture that can be immediately copied and made bespoke to your
next paper, whether your lab work is wet, dry, or somewhere in between.

2210.04627,2024-07-03,"Systematizing Cellular Complexity: A Hilbertian Approach To Biological
  Problems","  Examining individual components of cellular systems has been successful in
uncovering molecular reactions and interactions. However, the challenge lies in
integrating these components into a comprehensive system-scale map. This
difficulty arises due to factors such as missing links (unknown variables),
overlooked nonlinearities in high-dimensional parameter space, downplayed
natural noisiness and stochasticity, and a lack of focus on causal influence
and temporal dynamics. Composite static and phenomenological descriptions,
while appearing complicated, lack the essence of what makes the biological
systems truly ""complex"".
  The formalization of system-level problems is therefore important in
constructing a meta-theory of biology. Addressing fundamental aspects of
cellular regulation, adaptability, and noise management is vital for
understanding the robustness and functionality of biological systems. These
aspects encapsulate the challenges that cells face in maintaining stability,
responding to environmental changes, and harnessing noise for functionality.
This work examines these key problems that cells must solve, serving as a
template for such formalization and as a step towards the axiomatization of
biological investigations. Through a detailed exploration of cellular
mechanisms, particularly homeostatic configuration, ion channels and harnessing
noise, this paper aims to illustrate complex concepts and theories in a
tangible context, providing a bridge between abstract theoretical frameworks
and concrete biological phenomena.

researchers as a strategy to access technology for cutting-edge research.
Specifically, it is discussed what kind of open technologies are most enabling

already wide spread, in particular in countries with lower science funding,
which in turn is the basis for the development of open technologies. Beyond
financial accessibility, open hardware can be transformational to the
technology access of laboratories through advantages in local production and

ultimate expression, SDLs could usher a new paradigm of scientific research,
where the world is probed, interpreted, and explained by machines for human
benefit. While there are functioning SDLs in the fields of chemistry and
materials science, we contend that synthetic biology provides a unique
opportunity since the genome provides a single target for affecting the
incredibly wide repertoire of biological cell behavior. However, the level of
investment required for the creation of biological SDLs is only warranted if
directed towards solving difficult and enabling biological questions. Here, we
discuss challenges and opportunities in creating SDLs for synthetic biology.

  Particles with Fluid-Screen in the Context of Venus Life Finder Mission
  Concept Study","  Evidence of chemical disequilibria and other anomalous observations in the
Venusian atmosphere motivate the search for life within the planet's temperate
clouds. To find signs of a Venusian aerial biosphere, a dedicated
astrobiological space mission is required. Venus Life Finder (VLF) missions
encompass unique mission concepts with specialized instruments to search for
habitability indicators, biosignatures and even life itself. A key in the
search for life is direct capture, concentration and visualization of particles
of biological potential. Here, we present a short overview of Fluid-Screen (FS)
technology, a recent advancement in the dielectrophoretic (DEP) microbial
particle capture, concentration and separation. FS is capable of capturing and
separating biochemically diverse particles, including multicellular molds,
eukaryotic cells, different species of bacteria and even viruses, based on
particle dielectric properties. In this short communication, we discuss the
possible implementation of Fluid-Screen in the context of the VLF missions,
emphasizing the unique science output of the Fluid-Screen instrument. FS can be
coupled with other highly sophisticated instruments such as an autofluorescence
microscope or a laser desorption mass spectrometer. We discuss possible
configurations of Fluid-Screen that upon modification and testing, could be
adapted for Venus. We discuss the unique science output of the FS technology
that can capture biological particles in their native state and hold them in
the focal plane of the microscope for the direct imaging of the captured
material. We discuss the challenges for the proposed method posed by the

are a particularly challenging environment, other bodies of the solar system,
e.g., with liquid water present, might be especially suitable for Fluid-Screen
application.

Although other plants can be used for this purpose, the use of Sansevieria is
interesting and offers certain advantages because it absorbs CO$_2$ during the
night. The project could also provide a simple tool for high school students to

  Transmissibility and Pathogenesis of SARS Covid (CoV-2, CoV) and MERS Covid","  Significantly higher transmissibility of SARS CoV-2 (2019) compared to SARS
CoV (2003) can be attributed to mutations of structural proteins (Spike S,
Nucleocapsid N, Membrane M, and Envelope E) and the role played by
non-structural proteins (nsps) and accessory proteins (ORFs) for viral
replication, assembly and shedding. The non-structural proteins (nsps) avail
host protein synthesis machinery to initiate viral replication, along with
neutralization of host immune defense. The key protein out of the 16 nsps, is
the non-structural protein nsp1, also known as the leader protein. Nsp1 leads
the process of hijacking host resources by blocking host translation. This
paper concentrates on the analysis of nsps of SARS covid (CoV-2, CoV) and MERS
covid based on Cellular Automata enhanced Machine Learning (CAML) model
developed for study of biological strings. This computational model compares
deviation of structure - function of CoV-2 from that of CoV employing CAML
model parameters derived out of CA evolution of amino acid chains of nsps. This
comparative analysis points to - (i) higher transmissibility of CoV-2 compared
to CoV for major nsps, and (ii) deviation of MERS covid from SARS CoV in
respect of virulence and pathogenesis. A Machine Learning (ML) framework has
been designed to map the CAML model parameters to the physical domain features
reported in in-vitro/in-vivo/in-silico experimental studies. The ML framework
enables us to learn the permissible range of model parameters derived out of
mutational study of sixteen nsps of three viruses.

2301.08559,2023-06-05,The Lost Art of Mathematical Modelling,"  We provide a critique of mathematical biology in light of rapid developments
in modern machine learning. We argue that out of the three modelling activities
-- (1) formulating models; (2) analysing models; and (3) fitting or comparing
models to data -- inherent to mathematical biology, researchers currently focus
too much on activity (2) at the cost of (1). This trend, we propose, can be
reversed by realising that any given biological phenomena can be modelled in an
infinite number of different ways, through the adoption of an open/pluralistic
approach. We explain the open approach using fish locomotion as a case study
and illustrate some of the pitfalls -- universalism, creating models of models,
etc. -- that hinder mathematical biology. We then ask how we might rediscover a
lost art: that of creative mathematical modelling.

2301.09106,2023-08-24,The state of quantum computing applications in health and medicine,"  Medicine, including fields in healthcare and life sciences, has seen a flurry
of quantum-related activities and experiments in the last few years (although
biology and quantum theory have arguably been entangled ever since
Schr\""odinger's cat). The initial focus was on biochemical and computational
biology problems; recently, however, clinical and medical quantum solutions
have drawn increasing interest. The rapid emergence of quantum computing in
health and medicine necessitates a mapping of the landscape. In this review,
clinical and medical proof-of-concept quantum computing applications are
outlined and put into perspective. These consist of over 40 experimental and
theoretical studies. The use case areas span genomics, clinical research and
discovery, diagnostics, and treatments and interventions. Quantum machine
learning (QML) in particular has rapidly evolved and shown to be competitive
with classical benchmarks in recent medical research. Near-term QML algorithms
have been trained with diverse clinical and real-world data sets. This includes
studies in generating new molecular entities as drug candidates, diagnosing
based on medical image classification, predicting patient persistence,
forecasting treatment effectiveness, and tailoring radiotherapy. The use cases
and algorithms are summarized and an outlook on medicine in the quantum era,
including technical and ethical challenges, is provided.

2301.11126,2023-01-27,Three facets of mathematical cancer biology research,"  Cancer, as the uncontrollable cell growth, is related to many branches of
biology. In this review, we will discuss three mathematical approaches for
studying cancer biology: population dynamics, gene regulation, and
developmental biology. If we understand all biochemical mechanisms of cancer
cells, we can directly calculate how the cancer cell population behaves.
Inversely, just from the cell count data, we can use population dynamics to
infer the mechanisms. Cancer cells emerge from certain genetic mutations, which
affect the expression of other genes through gene regulation. Therefore,
knowledge of gene regulation can help with cancer prevention and treatment.
Developmental biology studies acquisition and maintenance of normal cellular
function, which is inspiring to cancer biology in the opposite direction.
Besides, cancer cells implanted into an embryo can differentiate into normal
tissues, which provides a possible approach of curing cancer. This review
illustrates the role of mathematics in these three fields: what mathematical
models are used, what data analysis tools are applied, and what mathematical
theorems need to be proved. We hope that applied mathematicians and even pure
mathematicians can find meaningful mathematical problems related to cancer

2301.11778,2023-01-30,"Reproducibility of health claims in meta-analysis studies of COVID
  quarantine (stay-at-home) orders","  The coronavirus pandemic (COVID) has been an extraordinary test of modern
government scientific procedures that inform and shape policy. Many governments
implemented COVID quarantine (stay-at-home) orders on the notion that this
nonpharmaceutical intervention would delay and flatten the epidemic peak and
largely benefit public health outcomes. The overall research capacity response
to COVID since late 2019 has been massive. Given lack of research transparency,
only a small fraction of published research has been judged by others to be
reproducible before COVID. Independent evaluation of published meta-analysis on
a common research question can be used to assess the reproducibility of a claim
coming from that field of research. We used a p-value plotting statistical
method to independently evaluate reproducibility of specific research claims
made in four meta-analysis studies related to benefits/risks of COVID
quarantine orders. Outcomes we investigated included: mortality, mental health
symptoms, incidence of domestic violence, and suicidal ideation (thoughts of
killing yourself). Three of the four meta-analyses that we evaluated
(mortality, mental health symptoms, incidence of domestic violence) raise
further questions about benefits/risks of this form of intervention. The fourth
meta-analysis study (suicidal ideation) is unreliable. Given lack of research
transparency and irreproducibility of published research, independent
evaluation of meta-analysis studies using p-value plotting is offered as a way
to strengthen or refute (falsify) claims made in COVID research.

  The University of Chicago Perspective","  Academic medical centers are generating an increasing amount of biomedical
data and there is an increasing demand for biomedical data for research
purposes by research projects, research consortia, companies, and other third
parties. At the same time, as the number of patients grows and the amount of
data per patient grows, there is an increasing possibility that some
information about some patients may become available if the data is shared with
third parties and the third parties have a data breach or violate the terms of
the data use agreement. Balancing the importance of research that may result in
improved patient outcomes with the importance of protecting patient data is
challenging. The article discusses the principles, considerations about risks
and mitigating risks, and guidelines used at the University of Chicago used for

  monitoring of enhanced rock weathering rates","  Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) is a promising scalable and cost-effective
Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) strategy with significant environmental and
agronomic co-benefits. A major barrier to large-scale implementation of ERW is
a robust Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) framework. To
successfully quantify the amount of carbon dioxide removed by ERW, MRV must be
accurate, precise, and cost-effective. Here, we outline a mass-balance-based
method where analysis of the chemical composition of soil samples is used to
track in-situ silicate rock weathering. We show that signal-to-noise issues of
in-situ soil analysis can be mitigated by using isotope-dilution mass
spectrometry to reduce analytical error. We implement a proof-of-concept
experiment demonstrating the method in controlled mesocosms. In our experiment,
basalt rock feedstock is added to soil columns containing the cereal crop
Sorghum bicolor at a rate equivalent to 50 t ha$^{-1}$. Using our approach, we
calculate rock weathering corresponding to an average initial CDR value of 1.44
+/- 0.27 tCO$_2$eq ha$^{-1}$ from our experiments after 235 days, within error
of an independent estimate calculated using conventional elemental budgeting of
reaction products. Our method provides a robust time-integrated estimate of
initial CDR, to feed into models that track and validate large-scale carbon
removal through ERW.

  and Cold/Hot herbs of formulae","  Objective: To discover biomarkers and uncover the mechanism of Cold/Hot ZHENG
(syndrome in traditional Chinese medicine) chronic gastritis (CG) and Cold/Hot
herbs in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulae on systematic biology.
Background: CG is a common inflammatory disease and the diagnosis of CG in TCM
can be classified into Cold ZHENG (Asthenic Cold) and Hot ZHENG (Excess Hot).
However, the molecular features of Cold/Hot ZHENG in CG and the mechanism of
Cold/Hot herbs in formulae for CG remained unclear. Methods: Based on data of
35 patients of Cold/Hot ZHENG CG and 3 scRNA-seq CG samples, we conduct
analysis with transcriptomics datasets and algorithms, to discover biomarkers
for Cold/Hot ZHENG CG. And we collected 25 formulae (with traditional effects
related to Cold/Hot ZHENG) for CG and corresponding 89 Cold/Hot herbs
(including Warm/Cool herbs) to discover features and construct target networks
of Cold/Hot herbs on the basis of network target and enrichment analysis.
Results: Biomarkers of Cold/Hot ZHENG CG represented by CCL2 and LEP suggested
that Hot ZHENG CG might be characterized by over-inflammation and exuberant
metabolism, and Cold ZHENG CG showed a trend of suppression in immune
regulation and energy metabolism. And biomarkers of Cold/Hot ZHENG showed also
significant changes in the progression of gastric cancer. And biomarkers and
pathways of Hot herbs intend to regulate immune responses and energy
metabolism, while those of Cold herbs were likely to participate in
anti-inflammation effect. Conclusion: In this study, we found that the
biomarkers and mechanism of Cold/Hot ZHENG CG and those of Cold/Hot herbs were
closely related to the regulation of immune and metabolisms. These findings may
reflect the mechanism, build bridges between multiple views of Cold/Hot ZHENG
and Cold/Hot herbs, and provide a research paradigm for further achieving
precision TCM.

2302.13340,2023-02-28,"Standardizing Paediatric Clinical Data: The Development of the
  conect4children (c4c) Cross Cutting Paediatric Data Dictionary","  Standardization of data items collected in paediatric clinical trials is an
important but challenging issue. The Clinical Data Interchange Standards
Consortium (CDISC) data standards are well understood by the pharmaceutical
industry but lack the implementation of some paediatric specific concepts. When
a paediatric concept is absent within CDISC standards, companies and research
institutions take multiple approaches in the collection of paediatric data,
leading to different implementations of standards and potentially limited
utility for reuse. To overcome these challenges, the conect4children consortium
has developed a cross-cutting paediatric data dictionary (CCPDD). The
dictionary was built over three phases - scoping (including a survey sent out
to ten industrial and 34 academic partners to gauge interest), creation of a
longlist and consensus building for the final set of terms. The dictionary was
finalized during a workshop with attendees from academia, hospitals, industry
and CDISC. The attendees held detailed discussions on each data item and
participated in the final vote on the inclusion of the item in the CCPDD. Nine
industrial and 34 academic partners responded to the survey, which showed
overall interest in the development of the CCPDD. Following the final vote on
27 data items, three were rejected, six were deferred to the next version and a
final opinion was sought from CDISC. The first version of the CCPDD with 25
data items was released in August 2019. The continued use of the dictionary has
the potential to ensure the collection of standardized data that is
interoperable and can later be pooled and reused for other applications. The
dictionary is already being used for case report form creation in three
clinical trials. The CCPDD will also serve as one of the inputs to the
Paediatric User Guide, which is being developed by CDISC.

protein samples on a hydrophobic membrane to be used for the patented
electrophoresis method developed by Chang and Yonan in 2008 [1]. This novel
method performs electrophoresis directly on hydrophobic blot membranes as
opposed to the previous popular methods such as the 2-D polyacrylamide gel
method [2, 3]. This new electrophoresis method significantly reduces the
processing time to about 40 minutes, as opposed to the 2-D PAGE method which
can take one or two days. Special methods to spot samples on hydrophobic blot
membranes were established for successful separation of protein and protein
complexes. These spotting methods are used in conjunction with the patented
electrophoresis method [1] for effective separation. The automated device
effectively replicates these special methods that are repeatable and user
independent. The goal of the automated device is to effectively spot and
separate protein complexes in addition to single proteins under non-denaturing
conditions, thus eliminating the variability of the manual spotting method.

to carry out many essential research tasks. However, despite a variety of
educational efforts, learning to write code can be a challenging endeavor for
both researchers and students in life science disciplines. Recent advances in
artificial intelligence have made it possible to translate human-language
prompts to functional code, raising questions about whether these technologies
can aid (or replace) life scientists' efforts to write code. Using 184
programming exercises from an introductory-bioinformatics course, we evaluated
the extent to which one such model -- OpenAI's ChatGPT -- can successfully
complete basic- to moderate-level programming tasks. On its first attempt,
ChatGPT solved 139 (75.5%) of the exercises. For the remaining exercises, we
provided natural-language feedback to the model, prompting it to try different
approaches. Within 7 or fewer attempts, ChatGPT solved 179 (97.3%) of the
exercises. These findings have important implications for life-sciences
research and education. For many programming tasks, researchers no longer need
to write code from scratch. Instead, machine-learning models may produce usable
solutions. Instructors may need to adapt their pedagogical approaches and
assessment techniques to account for these new capabilities that are available

that the two are complementary in shaping restoration and management solutions.
We thus underscore the importance of establishing monitoring programs focusing
on biodiversity-ecosystem linkages in order to inform evidence-based decisions

on the contribution of various non-pharmaceutical measures in breaking the 3rd
Corona wave in Germany. The main finding is that testing contributed more to
the containment of the pandemic in this phase than vaccination or contact
restrictions. The analysis is based on a new epidemiological cohort model that
represents testing, vaccination and contact restrictions by time-varying rates
of detection, vaccination and contacts, respectively.
  Only the effectiveness of different vaccines is taken from the literature.
All other parameters are automatically identified in such a way that the
simulated and the published incidences and death rates match. Among these
parameters are incubation time, mean duration of the infectious phase,
mortality rate, as well as two contact rates and one detection rate per week.
  Note that we can reconstruct such a high number of parameters only because we
assume that the weekly wave patterns in new infections follow real infection
dynamics, periodically driven by high contact rates on weekdays and lower ones
on weekends. Usually, people assume that the weekly wave patterns are just
reporting artefacts and that weekly mean values are the finest usable data.
  One focus of the paper is to quantify the increase in detection rate due to
the introduction of rapid testing in schools. For this purpose, we compare
federal states that differ in the start of school tests and Easter holidays.
There is a clear temporal correlation with the identified detection rates.
  Finally, we compare the effect of the individual non-pharmaceutical measures
by replacing one by one the fitted rates of detection, vaccination and contacts
by neutral ones. The increase in the simulated number of actually infected
persons measures the effect of the measure ignored.

root length, plant weight, and percentage yield were determined. The nitrate,
total nitrogen, phosphate, and total phosphorus content of the organic
fertilizer were also determined. Plant height in maize showed a 35.8-44.4 %
increase in fertilized maize and a 20.3-39.3 % increase in the leaf length.
There was a 38.8-66 % increase in root length and a 23.9-36.5 % increase in
plant weight in fertilized maize. The nutritive component was 59.80 mg/Kg,
655.56 mg/Kg, 103.87 mg/Kg, and 426.60 mg/Kg respectively. For a period of 21
days of active growth, the growth rate of maize primed with organic fertilizer
was 0.93 cm/day with a total yield of 100 % while the control was 0.68 cm/day

improved insights and predictions into temporal dynamics. In temporal
validation, our models substantially outperform the historical baseline. Our
findings suggest that similar dynamics apply across other scientific and

becoming rapidly available across many tissues. Notably, deconvolution
algorithms are frequently developed using samples from tissues with similar

with substantially different cell sizes, total mRNA expression, and
transcriptional activity. When existing deconvolution approaches are applied to
these tissues, these systematic differences in cell sizes and transcriptomic
activity confound accurate cell proportion estimates and instead may quantify
total mRNA content. Furthermore, there is a lack of standard reference atlases
and computational approaches to facilitate integrative analyses, including not
only bulk and single cell/nuclei RNA-seq data, but also new data modalities
from spatial -omic or imaging approaches. New multi-assay datasets need to be

energy recovery; however, it limits the applicability of secondary treatment
for acceptable effluent discharge into surface water bodies. To turn this
bottleneck issue into an opportunity, this study developed oxygen-induced
thiosulfatE production duRing sulfATe reductiOn (EARTO) to provide an efficient
electron donor for wastewater treatment. Typical pretreated wastewater was
synthesized with chemical oxygen demand of 110 mg/L, sulfate of 50 mg S/L, and
varying dissolved oxygen (DO) and was fed into a moving-bed biofilm reactor
(MBBR). The MBBR was operated continuously with a short hydraulic retention
time of 40 min for 349 days. The formation rate of thiosulfate reached
0.12-0.18 g S/(m2.d) with a high produced thiosulfate-S/TdS-S ratio of 38-73%
when influent DO was 2.7-3.6 mg/L. The sludge yield was 0.23-0.29 gVSS/gCOD,
much lower than it was in conventional activated sludge processes. Then, batch
tests and metabolism analysis were conducted to confirm the oxygen effect on
thiosulfate formation, characterize the roles of sulfate and microbial
activities, and explore the mechanism of oxygen-induced thiosulfate formation
in ERATO. Results examined that oxygen supply promoted the
thiosulfate-Sproduced/TdS-Sproduced ratio from 4% to 24-26%, demonstrated that
sulfate and microbial activities were critical for thiosulfate production, and
indicated that oxygen induces thiosulfate formation through two pathways: 1)
direct sulfide oxidation, and 2) indirect sulfide oxidation, sulfide is first
oxidized to S0 (dominant) which then reacts with sulfite derived from
oxygen-regulated biological sulfate reduction. The proposed compact ERATO
process, featuring high thiosulfate production and low sludge production,

  Transplantation","  Liver transplantation continues to be the gold standard for treating patients
with end-stage liver diseases. However, despite the huge success of liver
transplantation in improving patient outcomes, long term graft survival
continues to be a major problem. The current clinical practice in the
management of liver transplant patients is centered around immunosuppressive
multidrug regimens. Current research has been focusing on phenotypic
personalized medicine as a novel approach in the optimization of
immunosuppression, a regressional math modeling focusing on individual patient
dose and response using specific markers like transaminases. A prospective area
of study includes the development of a mechanistic computational math modeling
for optimizing immunosuppression to improve patient outcomes and increase
long-term graft survival by exploring the intricate immune/drug interactions to
help us further our understanding and management of medical problems like
transplants, autoimmunity, and cancer therapy. Thus, by increasing long-term
graft survival, the need for redo transplants will decrease, which will free up
organs and potentially help with the organ shortage problem promoting equity
and equal opportunity for transplants, as well as decreasing the medical costs
associated with additional testing and hospital admissions. Although long-term
graft survival remains challenging, computational and quantitative methods have
led to significant improvements. In this article, we review recent advances and
remaining opportunities. We focus on the following topics: donor organ
availability and allocation with a focus on equity, monitoring of patient and
graft health, and optimization of immunosuppression dosing.

challenge and characterizes the challenging cases that impacted the performance
of the winning algorithms. Untreated brain metastases on standard anatomic MRI
sequences (T1, T2, FLAIR, T1PG) from eight contributed international datasets
were annotated in stepwise method: published UNET algorithms, student,
neuroradiologist, final approver neuroradiologist. Segmentations were ranked
based on lesion-wise Dice and Hausdorff distance (HD95) scores. False positives
(FP) and false negatives (FN) were rigorously penalized, receiving a score of 0
for Dice and a fixed penalty of 374 for HD95. Eight datasets comprising 1303
studies were annotated, with 402 studies (3076 lesions) released on Synapse as
publicly available datasets to challenge competitors. Additionally, 31 studies
(139 lesions) were held out for validation, and 59 studies (218 lesions) were
used for testing. Segmentation accuracy was measured as rank across subjects,

engagement, justify additional funding, encourage additional use, identify
unanticipated use cases, and help define improvement areas. However, there are
challenges associated with these analyses including distorted or misleading
metrics, as well as ethical and security concerns. More attention to the
nuances involved in capturing impact across the spectrum of biological software

audience, yet may not have compelling typical usage metrics. We propose more
general guidelines, as well as strategies for more specific types of software.
We highlight outstanding issues regarding how communities measure or evaluate
software impact. To get a deeper understanding of current practices for
software evaluations, we performed a survey of participants in the Informatics
Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program funded by the National Cancer
Institute (NCI). We also investigated software among this community and others
to assess how often infrastructure that supports such evaluations is
implemented and how this impacts rates of papers describing usage of the
software. We find that developers recognize the utility of analyzing software
usage, but struggle to find the time or funding for such analyses. We also find
that infrastructure such as social media presence, more in-depth documentation,
the presence of software health metrics, and clear information on how to
contact developers seem to be associated with increased usage rates. Our
findings can help scientific software developers make the most out of
evaluations of their software.

  adaptive immune system","  The humoral adaptive immune system, from the physical perspective, can be
regarded as a self-organized antibody binding energy landscape. In biological
terms, the system organizes its repertoire of antigen binding molecules so as
to maintain its molecular integrity. In this article I reason that the
super-landscape created by the fusion of binding energy landscapes can be
described by the distribution of interaction energies and deformation
parameters of thermodynamic potentials in the system. The deformation
parameters characterize the network of interactions in the system and the
asymmetry of generalized logistic distributions obtained in immunoassays while
probing the system. Overall, a statistical thermodynamics approach can provide
a deeper theoretical insight both into the dynamical self-organization of the
adaptive immune system and into the interpretation of experimental results.

  genotyping of low template DNA A case study comparing STRmix and TrueAllele""","  Thompson reports a comparison of data from STRmix and TrueAllele. The data he
has arises from different inputs to the two software. If the input data are
made more similar the outputs become more similar. Thompson argues that the
Analytical Threshold, AT, should be varied in casework. This produced different
LRs but the analyst would be left deciding what to do with these options. This
cannot be based on the LRs but should be based on whether any movement in the
AT adds reliable or unreliable data. This is how most laboratories set their AT
in the first place. Hence it is pointless, and potentially dangerous, to
experimentally vary the AT in casework. The profile is low level and shows at
most three peaks. Thompson argues that LR results assuming that the number of

  variables that erode homeostasis and drive age-related decline of health","  Using longitudinal study data, we dynamically model how aging affects
homeostasis in both mice and humans. We operationalize homeostasis as a
multivariate mean-reverting stochastic process. We hypothesize that biomarkers
have stable equilibrium values, but that deviations from equilibrium of each
biomarker affects other biomarkers through an interaction network - this
precludes univariate analysis. We therefore looked for age-related changes to
homeostasis using dynamic network stability analysis, which transforms observed
biomarker data into independent ""natural"" variables and determines their
associated recovery rates. Most natural variables remained near equilibrium and
were essentially constant in time. A small number of natural variables were
unable to equilibrate due to a gradual drift with age in their homeostatic
equilibrium, i.e. allostasis. This drift caused them to accumulate over the
lifespan course and makes them natural aging variables. Their rate of
accumulation was correlated with risk of adverse outcomes: death or dementia
onset. We call this tendency for aging organisms to drift towards an
equilibrium position of ever-worsening health ""mallostasis"". We demonstrate
that the effects of mallostasis on observed biomarkers are spread out through
the interaction network. This could provide a redundancy mechanism to preserve
functioning until multi-system dysfunction emerges at advanced ages.

a standard drug classification system. Setting: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry. Data sources: 72 potion recipes from the Hogwarts curriculum,
extracted from the Harry Potter Wiki. Results: Most generated recipes fall into
the categories of psychoanaleptics and dermatologicals. The number of recipes
predicted for each category reflected the number of training recipes. Predicted
probabilities were often above 90% but some recipes were classified into 2 or
more categories with similar probabilities which complicates anticipating the

2307.01508,2024-09-09,Analysis of complex excitation patterns using Feynman-like diagrams,"  Many extended chemical and biological systems self-organise into complex
patterns that drive the medium behaviour in a non-linear fashion. An important
class of such systems are excitable media, including neural and cardiac
tissues. In extended excitable media, wave breaks can form rotating patterns
and turbulence. However, the onset, sustaining and elimination of such complex
patterns is currently incompletely understood. The classical theory of phase
singularities in excitable media was recently challenged, as extended lines of
conduction block were identified as phase discontinuities. Here, we provide a
theoretical framework that captures the rich dynamics in excitable systems in
terms of three quasiparticles: heads, tails, and pivots. We propose to call
these quasiparticles `cardions'. In simulations and experiments, we show that
these basic building blocks combine into at least four different bound states.
By representing their interactions similarly to Feynman diagrams in physics,
the creation and annihilation of vortex pairs are shown to be sequences of
dynamical creation, annihilation, and recombination of the identified
quasiparticles. We draw such diagrams for numerical simulations, as well as
optical voltage mapping experiments performed on cultured human atrial myocytes
(hiAMs). Our results provide a new, unified language for a more detailed
theory, analysis, and mechanistic insights of dynamical transitions in
excitation patterns.

functional level, known as the phenotype, which is then connected to a latent
phenotype we refer to as fitness. This underlying architecture governs the
processes that drive evolution. Moreover, natural selection, along with other

experimental and computational methods, we aim to create maps across hundreds
of cell types and states describing how coding variants alter protein activity,
how noncoding variants change the regulation of gene expression, and how both
coding and noncoding variants may connect through gene regulatory and protein

15-50 attending health centers. In this cross-sectional study, 362 female
participants aged 15-50 were recruited from health centers in Iraq. Serological
tests were used to screen for HPV infection. Sociodemographic information,
obstetric history, and contraceptive use were collected. Pap smears were
performed to assess cervical changes related to HPV infection. Of the 362
participants, 65 (17.96%) tested positive for HPV. The majority of HPV-positive
women were aged 30-35 years, housewives, and belonged to lower social classes.
Among HPV-positive women, 30% had abnormal Pap smears, with 55% diagnosed with
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1), 25% with CIN2, and 15% with
CIN3. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis in 5% of cases. No significant association
was found between HPV infection and contraceptive use. Most HPV-positive women
were multiparous. This study reveals a considerable prevalence of HPV infection
among Iraqi women attending health centers, particularly in the age group of
30-35 years and among housewives. These findings highlight the need for

commercialization of biofertilizers in Sri Lanka is of general interest. The
use of a biofilm-biofertilizer (BFBF) commercialized in Sri Lanka is claimed to
reduce chemical fertilizer (CF) usage by ~50 per cent while boosting harvest by
20-30 per cent. Many countries have explored the potential of biofilm

seemingly reduced CF scenario with an ""increase"" in harvests, although this is
in fact not so, are presented. While BFBF usage seems to improve soil quality
in certain respects, the currently available BFBF promoted in Sri Lanka has
negligible impact on crop yields. We also briefly consider the potential

to the strategic and crucial role that bioethanol holds in supporting the

experiments from said data and correlating the results with the parameters
using analytical tools. While the case examples analyzed relate to bioethanol
mostly, an additional analysis has been performed for data on biodiesel.
Coupled with confirmatory methods such as Principal Component Analysis,

built a carbon sequestration growth model driven by growth rate dependency
(GRDM). We abstracted the carbon cycling system into the process of
photosynthesis, the humidity fluctuation, and the original storage of carbon in
the trees. In the photosynthesis model, we considered various factors,
including transition rate of absorption and organic matter production. We also
designed an Economic Return Evaluation Model (EREM) to estimate the optimal
distribution of trees in the forest based on the utility function. Maximizing
the utility brought by the amount of carbon storage, we derived the equation
for profit optimization with the constraints of total economic expenses
allowed. To assess its performance, we took an object-oriented approach,
simulated an ideal forest by placing instances of trees and plotted a
time-dependent forest composition graph. After proper normalization of climate
and economic data, we also make predictions for 169 worldwide forest-covered
countries. Our model further suggests high sensitivity and robustness with a
similar trend of overall utility when environmental aridity or proportion of
harvested woods are varied. Finally, we apply the model to Georgia temperate
deciduous forest, and we evaluate the carbon storage ability to adjust the Red
Spruce based on available biological literature research. We recognize that
while the model is preliminary in its failure to identify a diverse array of

  combined chemotherapy and different types of radiation therapy in a
  glioblastoma patient","  Background: Gliomas are the most common brain tumors, which vary from low to
high-grade. Despite the improvements in imaging techniques in the last decade,
all parts of the tumor are not visible in these images, due to having a
threshold of detection often lower than most of the tumor. Method: We simulated
a brain domain to model heterogeneous growth plus gross total resection
following concurrent chemo- and radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy
using temozolomide for a patient, diagnosed with glioblastoma, for different
radiobiological alpha parameter as high, medium, and low sensitivity. The
extent of difference in the result of treatment, area of the tumor, and
survival time relating to those sensitivity parameters were shown. Moreover,
based on the threshold of detection of MRI (T1Gd), the area of the tumor
visible to this imaging technique was simulated. Furthermore, the extent of
difference in the result of treatment for both conventional and
hyperfractionated radiotherapy was investigated. Conclusion: The survival time
of patient was increased by 2 months and more than 3 months at the lowest and
highest sensitivity of radiation therapy, respectively.The result showed
hyperfractionated radiotherapy was more effective than conventional
radiotherapy in reducing the concentration of cancerous cells,as
hyperfractionated method allows administration of higher total dose.

facility, comprising 42 aquaria capable of division into up to 126
compartments, a flow-through rack for juveniles, egg tumblers for eggs and
embryos, and a microinjection setup, provides a comprehensive environment for
all life stages of cichlid fishes. We anticipate that a similar design can be

  statistical power for cluster analysis, latent class analysis, and
  multivariate mixture models","  Before embarking on data collection, researchers typically compute how many
individual observations they should do. This is vital for doing studies with
sufficient statistical power, and often a cornerstone in study
pre-registrations and grant applications. For traditional statistical tests,
one would typically determine an acceptable level of statistical power,
(gu)estimate effect size, and then use both values to compute the required
sample size. However, for analyses that identify subgroups, statistical power
is harder to establish. Once sample size reaches a sufficient threshold, effect
size is primarily determined by the number of measured features and the
underlying subgroup separation. As a consequence, a priory computations of
statistical power are notoriously complex. In this tutorial, I will provide a
roadmap to determining sample size and effect size for analyses that identify
subgroups. First, I introduce a procedure that allows researchers to formalise
their expectations about effect sizes in their domain of choice, and use this
to compute the minimally required number of measured variables. Next, I outline
how to establish the minimum sample size in subgroup analyses. Finally, I use
simulations to provide a reference table for the most popular subgroup
analyses: k-means, Ward agglomerative hierarchical clustering, c-means fuzzy
clustering, latent class analysis, latent profile analysis, and Gaussian
mixture modelling. The table shows the minimum numbers of observations per
expected subgroup (sample size) and features (measured variables) to achieve
acceptable statistical power, and can be readily used in study design.

  Learning Algorithms to Combat Food Waste and Food Borne Illnesses","  The issue of food waste is a major problem contributing to the emission of
greenhouse gases into the environment in addition to causing illness in humans.
This research aimed to develop a correlation between the amount of time until a
food spoiled and dates on food labels in conjunction with sensory observations.
Sensory observations are more accurate as they are immediate observations that
are specific to the food. This experiment observed bananas, bread, milk, eggs,
and leafy greens over a period of time using characteristics specific to the
food to quantify food spoilage. It was shown that the actual time until
spoilage for all foods was longer than that of the best by date and that
sensory observations proved to be a more accurate factor in determining
spoilage. From this data, a machine learning algorithm was trained to predict
if food was spoiled or not, in addition to the number of days until spoilage.
This was presented to the consumer as an app, where the user can track foods
and are reminded to check on them to prevent wastage. In addition, the
experimental procedures were incorporated into a test kit for the consumer to
take instructed observations to assess the spoilage of their food, which are
then entered into the app to improve the algorithm. This paper discusses the
individual effects of sensorial observations on each food and examines the
shifting of consumer habits through an app and test kit to combat environmental
consequences of food waste.

2309.03425,2024-05-14,Exponential Cell Division and Allometric Scaling in Metabolic Ecology,"  One of the most fundamental rules in metabolic ecology is the allometric
equation, which is a power-law scaling that describes the connection between
body measurements and body size. The biological dynamics of this essentially
empirical allometric equation, however, have yet to be properly addressed in
cell level. In order to fill the gap between biological process in cell level
and allometric scaling in metabolic ecology, we simply assumed a cell
bipartition without limitation, and then exponential cells increased during
their lifetime. Two synchronous exponential increasing could generate a
power-law scaling between body mass and an organ's weight. And the power-law
scaling between body mass and metabolic rate may also be obtained by
substituting an organ's weight with the weight of erythrocytes. Based on the
same assumption, the dynamic of cell proliferation reveal a complex exponential
scaling between body mass and longevity rather than the previously reported
power-law scaling. In other words, there is a quadratic relationship between
longevity and logarithmic form of body mass. In these relationships, all
parameters can be explained by indices in cell division and embryo.

in socio-technical systems, AI's potential impacts on global health, and
balancing data privacy with transparency. Panel discussions examined the
cultural, political, and ethical dimensions of AI in global health. FairMI4GH
aimed to stimulate dialogue, facilitate knowledge transfer, and spark
innovative solutions. Drawing from NIST's AI Risk Management Framework, it
provided suggestions for handling AI risks and biases. The need to mitigate
data biases from the research design stage, adopt a human-centered approach,

2309.07194,2023-10-06,"Clinical dichotomania: A major cause of over-diagnosis and
  over-treatment?","  Introduction: There have been many warnings that inappropriate
dichotomisation of results into positive or negative, high, or normal etc.,
during medical research could be very damaging. The aim of this paper is to
argue that this is the main cause of over-diagnosis and over-treatment.
Methods: Illustrative data were taken from a randomised control trial (RCT)
that compared the frequency of nephropathy within 2 years in those on treatment
with an angiotensin receptor blocker and a control and on patients in whom the
numerical value of the albumin excretion rate (AER) was available on all
patients before they are randomised. Results: When the RCT results were divided
into AER ranges, a negligible proportion developed nephropathy within 2 years
and benefited from treatment in the range 20 to 40mcg/min in which 36% of
currently treated patients fall (and are thus over-diagnosed and overtreated).
Above an AER of 40mcg/min, there was a gradual increase in proportions with
nephropathy in each range, with fewer developing nephropathy in each range on
irbesartan 150mg daily than on control and fewer still developing nephropathy
on 300mg daily. Interpretation: When logistic regression functions were fitted
to the data and calibrated, curves were created that allowed outcome
probabilities and absolute risk reductions to be estimated for use in shared
decision making (illustrated by application to an example patient). This could
avoid much overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Conclusion: Careful attention to
disease severity by interpreting each numerical diagnostic result provides
better application of the principles of diagnosis and treatment decisions that
can prevent over-diagnosis and over-treatment.

  Saffron Stigma Development","  Crocus sativus L., otherwise known as saffron, is a highly prized plant due
to its unique triploid capability and elongated stigmas, contributing to its
status as the costly spice globally. The color and taste properties of saffron
are linked to carotenoid elements including cis- and trans-crocin, picrocrocin,
and safranal. In the research carried out, we dedicated our attention to the
gene CsZCD, an important player in the formation of apocarotenoids. Through the
application of real-time polymerase chain reaction to RNA purified from saffron
stigmas at various growth phases, it was determined that the peak expression of
the CsZCD gene coincided with the red stage, which is associated with the
highest concentration of apocarotenoids. The data showed a 2.69-fold
enhancement in CsZCD gene expression during the red phase, whereas a 0.90-fold
and 0.69-fold reduction was noted at the stages characterized by orange and
yellow hues, respectively. A noteworthy observation was that CsZCD's expression
was three times that of the CsTUB gene. Additionally, relative to CsTUB, CsLYC
displayed 0.7-fold and 0.3-times expression. Our investigation provides insight
into the governance of CsZCD during stigma maturation and its possible
influence on the fluctuation in apocarotenoid content. These discoveries carry
significance for the industrial production of saffron spice and underscore the
importance of additional studies on pivotal genes participating in the
synthesis of apocarotenoids.

having desirable quality attributes. Hence, analyses of fruit quality traits of
mini watermelon are crucial to develop improved cultivars with enhanced
nutritional compositions, consumer-preferred traits and extended storage life.
In this context, fruit morphological and nutritional attributes of five mini
watermelon genotypes namely BARI watermelon 1 (W1), BARI watermelon 2 (W2),
L-32468 (W3), L-32236 (W4) and L-32394 (W5) were evaluated to appraise
promising genotypes with better fruit quality. The evaluated genotypes
expressed different levels of diversity for fruit physical qualitative traits
including differences in shape, rind and flesh color and texture. The study
also revealed significant variability among the genotypes regarding all
observed fruit morphological and nutritional aspects as well as bioactive
compounds. Among the studied genotypes, W1 stood out with the highest TSS as
well as rind vitamin C and total phenolic content accompanied by higher fruit
weight and thick rind. On the other hand, W3 genotype was featured with higher
amount of \b{eta} carotene, total phenolic and flavonoid content in its flesh
along with rind enriched with \b{eta} carotene and minerals. However,
comparatively higher amount of sugar and total flavonoid content was recorded
in the rind of W5 genotype. Therefore, W1 and W3 could be exploited for table
purpose and using in breeding program to develop mini watermelon cultivars with
more attractive fruits in terms of quality acceptance and nutritional value in

  Study","  Human behavior training in improvisational theater has shown extensive
behavioral and health benefits. Improved empathy measures in medical students,
improved behavior outcome in patients with autism and a reduced recidivism rate
are among the many benefits attributed to improvisational theater training.
However, measuring tangible outcomes of changed behavior is challenging and
usually requires multiple sessions or months of training. One of the principal
tenets of improvisational theater is to actively listen and collaboratively
allow a scene partner to talk and provide equal input as needed. Here we
measured human speech epochs and asked if a month of weekly improvisational
theater training would reflect in speech epoch assays. We found a significant
decrease in speech epoch durations after one month of weekly training. There
was no change in epoch durations on the same day, suggesting it to be a stable
parameter over a day, but amenable to modulation over a month of training. The
overall rhythm of speech epochs remained unchanged but durations of discrete
low frequency speech volleys increased. Moreover, training improved regularity
of adjacent speech epoch durations, suggesting a better sharing of speaking
focus by matching speech time to the previous speech epoch duration. Our assay
provides a proof-of-concept study of empathy-relevant tractable speech epoch
parameters associated with changes in a month after human behavior training.

enigmatic. The endosymbiotic hypothesis that chloroplasts, mitochondria and

of de novo organelle biogenesis in the cyanobacterium TDX16 that had acquired
the genome of its green algal host Haematococcus pluvialis overturns this
hypothesis. In light of organelle biogenesis in the cyanobacterium TDX16 in
combination with the relevant cellular and molecular evidence, we propose
genome hybridization hypothesis (GHH) that the origin of organelles and origin
of eukaryotes as well as the diversification of organelles and speciation of
eukaryotes are unified and achieved by genome hybridization: the endosymbiotic
cyanobacteria or bacteria obtain genomes of their archaebacterial or eukaryotic
hosts and hybridize with their own ones resulting in expanded genomes
containing a mixture of hybrid prokaryotic genes and eukaryotic genes, and thus
the cyanobacteria or bacteria have to compartmentalize to accommodate different
genes for specialized function of photosynthesis (chloroplast), respiration
(mitochondrion) and DNA preservation (nucleus), and consequently turn into
photosynthetic or heterotrophic eukaryotes. Accordingly, eukaryotes and their
organelles are of multiple origin, while the formation of cancer cells is the
speciation of eukaryotes as cancer cells are new species of unicellular
eukaryotes arising from bacteria. Therefore, GHH provides a theoretical
framework unifying evolutionary biology, cancer biology and cell biology and
directing the integrated multidisciplinary research.

purpose of prolonging production duration that provide the cuttings with the
best condition at the time of planting. The results have been obtained from
cold storage of carnations and chrysanthemums confirmed the fact that the
herbaceous cuttings could be stored for about two months at not lower than 0 C
and more than 4 C, with similar results of the cuttings directly planted
without storage. On the other hand, hardwood cuttings are stored at low
temperature in order to improve rooting ability via reducing rooting inhibitors
that occur in dormant cuttings which were taken during dormant seasons (late
fall or early winter). So, declining in rooting inhibitors has been observed in
the hardwood cuttings of deciduous trees and Vitis spp which were subjected to
low temperature for around 2-6 months. Consequently, rooting was improved in
these species. Also, cold storage of cuttings of some coniferous trees
increased rooting at a high rate. Other factors like cultivar and storage
method may interact with cold storage duration and temperature degree as well.

pipelines to combine and holistically interpret the results of such assays are
immature and require further investments to exploit new technologies. In this
manuscript, we discuss potential immunologically based bioagent-agnostic
approaches and the computational tool gaps the community should prioritize
filling.

  cassava starch (Manihot esculenta) reinforced by chitosan extracted from crab
  (Shylla seratta) shells","  Bioplastics are polymer plastics which are derived from renewable biomass
resources. In this study, bioplastic films based on two different
polysaccharides such as bitter cassava starch and chitosan extracted from crab
shells were produced by casting technique, using glycerol as plasticizer. The
purposes of this research are to characterize and to figure out the effect of
additional chitosan concentrations (0; 10; 20; 30; 50% by weight of starch) on
the physicochemical, mechanical and water barrier properties of bioplastic
films. The film's solubility in water (S), water absorption capacity (WAP),
water vapor permeability (WVP), tensile strength (TS), elongation at break (E),
Young's modulus (YM) and biodegradability were investigated. The possible
interactions between starch and chitosan molecules were evaluated by Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). From the analysis, the incorporation of
the chitosan shows improved results on the water barrier properties of the
bioplastic films. Optimum solubility in water, water absorption capacity, and
water vapor permeability are obtained on the composition of starch/chitosan was
50/50. Actually, the addition of chitosan increased tensile strength, and
elongation at break. The characterization of optimum mechanical proprieties
also occurred on the 50/50 composition of cassava-starch and chitosan. At this
ratio, tensile strength obtained were 6,3000 MPa; and the elongation at break
were 62,8571%. It was found that cassava-starch/chitosan-based films have a
stable structure compared to native cassava-starch films.

2310.18374,2024-02-23,Forum on immune digital twins: a meeting report,"  Medical digital twins are computational models of human biology relevant to a
given medical condition, which can be tailored to an individual patient,
thereby predicting the course of disease and individualized treatments, an
important goal of personalized medicine. The immune system, which has a central
role in many diseases, is highly heterogeneous between individuals, and thus
poses a major challenge for this technology. If medical digital twins are to
faithfully capture the characteristics of a patient's immune system, we need to
answer many questions, such as: What do we need to know about the immune system
to build mathematical models that reflect features of an individual? What data
do we need to collect across the different scales of immune system action? What
are the right modeling paradigms to properly capture immune system complexity?
In February 2023, an international group of experts convened in Lake Nona, FL
for two days to discuss these and other questions related to digital twins of
the immune system. The group consisted of clinicians, immunologists,
biologists, and mathematical modelers, representative of the interdisciplinary
nature of medical digital twin development. A video recording of the entire
event is available. This paper presents a synopsis of the discussions, brief
descriptions of ongoing digital twin projects at different stages of progress.
It also proposes a 5-year action plan for further developing this technology.
The main recommendations are to identify and pursue a small number of promising
use cases, to develop stimulation-specific assays of immune function in a
clinical setting, and to develop a database of existing computational immune
models, as well as advanced modeling technology and infrastructure.

2311.00015,2023-11-02,"Next-generation MRD assays: do we have the tools to evaluate them
  properly?","  Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) detection of molecular residual disease (MRD)
in solid tumours correlates strongly with patient outcomes and is being adopted
as a new clinical standard. ctDNA levels are known to correlate with tumor
volume, and although the absolute levels vary across indication and histology,
its analysis is driving the adoption of MRD. MRD assays must detect tumor when
imaging cannot and, as such, require very high sensitivity to detect the low
levels of ctDNA found after curative intent therapy. The minimum threshold is
0.01% Tumour Fraction but current methods like Archer and Signatera are limited
by detection sensitivity resulting in some patients receiving a false negative
call thereby missing out on earlier therapeutic intervention. Multiple vendors
are increasing the number of somatic variants tracked in tumour-informed and
personalized NGS assays, from tens to thousands of variants. Most recently,
assays using other biological features of ctDNA, e.g methylation or
fragmentome, have been developed at the LOD required for clinical utility.
These uniformed, or tumour-naive and non-personalised assays may be more
easily, and therefore more rapidly, adopted in the clinic. However, this rapid
development in MRD assay technology results in significant challenges in
benchmarking these new technologies for use in clinical trials. This is further
complicated by the fact that previous reference materials have focused on
somatic variants, and do not retain all of the epigenomic features assessed by
newer technologies. In this Comments and Controversy paper, we detail what is
known and what remains to be determined for optimal reference materials of MRD
methods and provide opinions generated during three-years of MRD technology
benchmarking in AstraZeneca Translational Medicine to help guide the community
conversation.

  relapses in Australian females with multiple sclerosis","  A higher Mediterranean diet score has been associated with lower likelihood
of multiple sclerosis. However, evidence regarding its association with disease
activity and progression is limited. Using data from the AusLong Study, we
tested longitudinal associations (over 10 years follow-up) between the
alternate Mediterranean diet score (aMED) and aMED-Red (including moderate
consumption of unprocessed red meat) and time between relapses and disability
measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (n=132; 27 males, 105
females). We used covariate-adjusted survival analysis for time between
relapses, and time series mixed-effects negative binomial regression for EDSS.
After adjusting for covariates, both higher aMED (aHR=0.94, 95%CI: 0.90, 0.99,
p=0.009) and higher aMED-Red (aHR=0.93, 95%CI: 0.89, 0.97, p=0.001) were
associated with significantly longer time between relapses in females. Whether
specific dietary components of a Mediterranean diet are important in relation
to relapses merits further study.

  cutting pattern","  Study two cut patterns in hardwood cuttings of (Cydonia oblonga), (Punica
granatum) and (Ficus carica). The cuttings have been cut either straight with
different internode stub lengths [0 (just onto the basal node as control), 0.5,
1.0, 2.0 or 3.0 cm below the basal node], or slant with 45 degree angle for
each length mentioned above (except the first length (0 cm). Effect of the
basal cut directions on rooting percentage and other shoot and root
characteristics were not significantly different, while the effect of slant cut
pattern on one-side rooting at the basal margin observed in some quince
cuttings but it was rarely observed in pomegranate and fig cuttings. Quince
cuttings gave no different rooting percentage and other shoot and root
characteristics significantly with different internode stub lengths. While,
internode stub 1 and 2 cm in pomegranate cuttings, and 0 cm in fig cuttings
gave the best rooting percentages 44.44% and 100%, respectively. Also,
interaction effects of the two factors on rooting percentage and other shoot
and root characteristics were just significantly different in pomegranate and
fig cuttings. The best rooting capacity achieved in pomegranate cuttings
(49.99%) in those were cut straightly at the base with 1 and 2 cm basal
internode stub lengths, and fig cuttings straightly cut at the base with 0 and
1 cm basal internode stub lengths gave the highest rooting capacity (100%).

2311.08546,2023-11-16,A Category of Genes,"  Understanding how genes interact and relate to each other is a fundamental
question in biology. However, current practices for describing these
relationships, such as drawing diagrams or graphs in a somewhat arbitrary
manner, limit our ability to integrate various aspects of the gene functions
and view the genome holistically. To overcome these limitations, we need a more
appropriate way to describe the intricate relationships between genes.
Interestingly, category theory, an abstract field of mathematics seemingly
unrelated to biology, has emerged as a powerful language for describing
relations in general. We propose that category theory could provide a framework
for unifying our knowledge of genes and their relationships.
  As a starting point, we construct a category of genes, with its morphisms
abstracting various aspects of the relationships betweens genes. These
relationships include, but not limited to, the order of genes on the
chromosomes, the physical or genetic interactions, the signalling pathways, the
gene ontology causal activity models (GO-CAM) and gene groups. Previously, they
were encoded by miscellaneous networks or graphs, while our work unifies them
in a consistent manner as a category. By doing so, we hope to view the
relationships between genes systematically. In the long run, this paves a
promising way for us to understand the fundamental principles that govern gene
regulation and function.

  (Callistemon viminalis)","  The study was conducted at the Collage of Agricultural Engineering Sciences,
University of Sulaimani, Kurdistan Region-Iraq so as to investigate response
hardwood cuttings of Callistemon viminalis to some plant extracts. The hardwood
cuttings were taken on 11 March 2021 and soaked separately in 3 and 6 g/L
aqueous extracts of moringa leaf, licorice root, willow shoot, fenugreek seed
and cinnamon bark for 1 hour. They were compared to the cuttings dipped in 3000
ppm IBA for 10s and control cuttings which were soaked in distilled water for 1
hour. The experiment laid out in CRD with three replications in a greenhouse,
and each replication included six cuttings which planted in a mixture of sand
and rice husk medium. The results showed that the highest (86.66%) rooting was
achieved in the cuttings treated with 6 g/L licorice extract and they were
significantly different with control cuttings (53.33%), but they were not
significantly different with 3000 ppm IBA (66.66%). Cinnamon 3g/L and fenugreek
3g/L extracts gave the lowest (6.66% and 33.33%, respectively) rooting and
other studied parameters. The cuttings dipped in 3000 ppm IBA gave the highest
(18.91) root number and the highest (66.66%) survival cuttings after
transplanting. The longest root (15.54 cm) was found in cuttings were treated
with 6 g/L moringa extract. The longest (5.83 cm) shoot was observed in treated
cuttings with 3 g/L willow extract. The highest chlorophyll a and b (10.08 and
4.62 mg/L, respectively) were observed in cuttings treated with 6 g/L willow
extract. Moreover, 3000 ppm IBA gave the highest (20.23%) total carbohydrate
and (1.77 mg/g) IAA content along with 6 g/L licorice, moringa and fenugreek
extracts, after 30 days from planting of the cuttings. Licorice root extract at
6 g/L fairly improved the measurements similar to 3000 ppm IBA throughout the
study.

2311.12080,2023-11-22,"Exploring the Relationship Between COVID-19 Induced Economic Downturn
  and Women's Nutritional Health Disparities","  This study explores how the COVID-19 pandemic's economic impact has
exacerbated nutritional health disparities among women. It sought to understand
the effects of economic challenges on women's dietary choices and access to
nutritious food across different socioeconomic groups. Using a mixed-methods
approach, the research combined quantitative data from health and economic
records with qualitative insights from interviews with diverse women. The study
analyzed trends in nutritional health and economic factors before and after the
pandemic and gathered personal accounts regarding nutrition and economic
difficulties during this period. Findings showed a clear link between the
economic downturn and deteriorating nutritional health, particularly in
low-income and marginalized groups. These women reported decreased access to
healthy foods and an increased dependence on less nutritious options due to
budget constraints, leading to a decline in dietary quality. This trend was
less evident in higher-income groups, highlighting stark disparities. The
pandemic intensified pre-existing nutritional inequalities, with the most
vulnerable groups facing greater adverse effects. However, community support
and public health measures provided some relief. In summary, the pandemic's
economic repercussions have indirectly impaired women's nutritional health,
especially among the socioeconomically disadvantaged. This highlights the
necessity for tailored nutritional interventions and economic policies focused
on safeguarding women's health.

2312.02187,2023-12-06,Timing decisions as the next frontier for collective intelligence,"  The past decade has witnessed a dramatically growing interest in collective
intelligence - the phenomenon of groups having an ability to make more accurate
decisions than isolated individuals. However, the vast majority of studies to
date have focused, either explicitly or implicitly, on spatial decisions (e.g.,
potential nest sites, food patches, or migration directions). We highlight the
equally important, but severely understudied, realm of temporal collective
decision-making, i.e., decisions about when to perform an action. We argue that
temporal collective decision making is likely to differ from spatial decision
making in several crucial ways and probably involves different mechanisms,
model predictions, and experimental outcomes. We anticipate that research
focused on temporal decisions should lead to a radically expanded understanding
of the adaptiveness and constraints of living in groups.

  physical modification of AgNPs-decorated PEEK","  In the case of polymer medical devices, the surface design plays a crucial
role in contact with human tissue. The use of AgNPs as antibacterial agents is
well known; however, their anchoring into the polymer surface can still be
investigated. This work describes the change in surface morphology and
behaviour in the biological environment of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) with
immobilised AgNPs after different surface modifications. The initial composites
were prepared by immobilisation of silver nanoparticles from a colloid solution
into the upper surface layers of polyetheretherketone (PEEK). The prepared
samples (Ag/PEEK) had a planar morphology and were further modified with a KrF
laser, a GaN laser, and Ar plasma. The samples were studied using the AFM
method to visualise changes in surface morphology and to obtain information on
the height of the structures and other surface parameters. Comparative analysis
of the nanoparticles and polymers was performed using FEG-SEM. The chemical
composition of the surface of the samples and optical activity were studied by
XPS and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Finally, drop plate antibacterial and cytotoxicity
tests were performed to determine the role of Ag nanoparticles after
modification and suitability of the surface, which are important for the use of
the resulting composite in biomedical applications.

enables the answering of scientific questions that cannot be addressed using
single data sources due to limited variables. The potential of linked data for
health research is enormous, as it can enhance prevention, treatment, and
population health policies. Due the sensitivity of health data, there are
strict legal requirements to prevent potential misuse. However, these
requirements also limit the use of health data for research, thereby hindering
innovations in prevention and care. Also, comprehensive Record linkage in
Germany is often challenging due to lacking unique personal identifiers or
interoperable solutions. Rather, the need to protect data is often weighed
against the importance of research aiming at healthcare enhancements: for
instance, data protection officers may demand the informed consent of
individual study participants for data linkage, even when this is not
mandatory. Furthermore, legal frameworks may be interpreted differently on
varying occasions. Given both, technical and legal challenges, record linkage
for health research in Germany falls behind the standards of other European
countries. To ensure successful record linkage, case-specific solutions must be
developed, tested, and modified as necessary before implementation. This paper
discusses limitations and possibilities of various data linkage approaches
tailored to different use cases in compliance with the European General Data
Protection Regulation. It further describes requirements for achieving a more
research-friendly approach to linking health data records in Germany.
Additionally, it provides recommendations to legislators. The objective of this
work is to improve record linkage for health research in Germany.

  the crystal basis model","  Analyzing the codon usage frequencies of a specimen of 20 plants, for which
the codon-anticodon pattern is known, we have remarked that the hierarchy of
the usage frequencies present an almost ""universal"" behavior. Searching to
explain this behavior, we assume that the codon usage probability results from
the sum of two contributions: the first dominant term is an almost ""universal""
one and it depends on the codon-anticodon interaction; the second term is a
local one, i.e. depends on the biological species. The codon-anticodon
interaction is written as a spin-spin plus a z-spin term in the formalism of
the crystal basis model. From general considerations, in particular from the
choice of the signs and some constraints on the parameters defining the
interaction, we are able to explain most of the observed data.

much easier to find than guidance for reporting their use, leaving biologists
to guess which details and files are relevant. Here, we provide a set of
recommendations for sharing code, with an eye toward guiding those who are
comparatively new to applying open science principles to their computational
work. Additionally, we review existing literature on the topic, summarize the
most common tips, and evaluate the code-sharing policies of the most
influential journals in biology, which occasionally encourage code-sharing but
seldom require it. Taken together, we provide a user manual for biologists who
seek to follow code-sharing best practices but are unsure where to start.

ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry. The greatest mean concentrations of PK
were found in kale (565 ug/100 g), baby spinach (255 ug/100 g) and Brussels
sprouts (195 ug/100 g). The data contribute to the global collection of vitamin
K food composition data. They add to the evidence that PK concentrations vary
markedly between geographic regions, supporting development of region-specific

2401.17325,2024-02-01,"Variation in Patterns of Metal Accumulation in Thallus Parts of Lessonia
  trabeculata (Laminariales; Phaeophyceae): Implications for Biomonitoring","  Seaweeds are well known to concentrate metals from seawater and have been
employed as monitors of metal pollution in coastal waters and estuaries.
However, research showing that various intrinsic and extrinsic factors can
influence metal accumulation, raises doubts about the basis for using seaweeds
in biomonitoring programmes. The thallus of brown seaweeds of the order
Laminariales (kelps) is morphologically complex but there is limited
information about the variation in metal accumulation between the different
parts, which might result in erroneous conclusions being drawn if not accounted
for in the biomonitoring protocol. To assess patterns of individual metals in
the differentiated parts of the thallus (blade, stipe, holdfast),
concentrations of a wide range of essential and non-essential metals (Fe, Cr,
Cu, Zn, Mn, Pb, Cd, Ni and Al) were measured in the kelp Lessonia trabeculata.
Seaweeds were collected from three sampling stations located at 5, 30 and 60 m
from an illegal sewage outfall close to Ventanas, Chile and from a pristine
location at Faro Curaumilla. For the majority of metals the highest
concentrations in bottom sediment and seaweed samples were found at the site
closest to the outfall, with concentrations decreasing with distance from the
outfall and at control stations; the exception was Cd, concentrations of which
were higher at control stations. The patterns of metal concentrations in
different thallus parts were metal specific and independent of sampling
station. These results and the available literature suggest that biomonitoring
of metals using seaweeds must take account of differences in the accumulation
of metals in thallus parts of complex seaweeds

2401.17678,2024-02-01,"How Being Inside or Outside of Buildings Affects the Causal Relationship
  Between Weather and Pain Among People Living with Chronic Pain","  Although many people believe their pain fluctuates with weather conditions,
both weather and pain may be associated with time spent outside. For example,
pleasant weather may mean that people spend more time outside doing physical
activity and exposed to the weather, leading to more (or less) pain, and poor
weather or severe pain may keep people inside, sedentary, and not exposed to
the weather. We conducted a smartphone study where participants with chronic
pain reported daily pain severity, as well as time spent outside. We address
the relationship between four weather variables (temperature, dewpoint
temperature, pressure, and wind speed) and pain by proposing a three-step
approach to untangle their effects: (i) propose a set of plausible directed
acyclic graphs (also known as DAGs) that account for potential roles of time
spent outside (e.g., collider, effect modifier, mediator), (ii) analyze the
compatibility of the observed data with the assumed model, and (iii) identify
the most plausible model by combining evidence from the observed data and
domain-specific knowledge. We found that the data do not support time spent
outside as a collider or mediator of the relationship between weather variables
and pain. On the other hand, time spent outside modifies the effect between
temperature and pain, as well as wind speed and pain, with the effect being
absent on days that participants spent inside and present if they spent some or
all of the day outside. Our results show the utility of using directed acyclic
graphs for studying causal inference.

increases biorisks and brings about a new set of dual use concerns. The picture
is complicated given the vast innovations envisioned to emerge by combining
emerging technologies, as AI-enabled synthetic biology potentially scales up
bioengineering into industrial biomanufacturing. However, the literature review
indicates that goals such as maintaining a reasonable scope for innovation, or
more ambitiously to foster a huge bioeconomy don't necessarily contrast with
biosafety, but need to go hand in hand. This paper presents a literature review
of the issues and describes emerging frameworks for policy and practice that
transverse the options of command-and control, stewardship, bottom-up, and
laissez-faire governance. How to achieve early warning systems that enable
prevention and mitigation of future AI-enabled biohazards from the lab, from
deliberate misuse, or from the public realm, will constantly need to evolve,
and adaptive, interactive approaches should emerge. Although biorisk is subject
to an established governance regime, and scientists generally adhere to
biosafety protocols, even experimental, but legitimate use by scientists could
lead to unexpected developments. Recent advances in chatbots enabled by
generative AI have revived fears that advanced biological insight can more
easily get into the hands of malignant individuals or organizations. Given
these sets of issues, society needs to rethink how AI-enabled synthetic biology
should be governed. The suggested way to visualize the challenge at hand is
whack-a-mole governance, although the emerging solutions are perhaps not so

  Predictive Deep Learning Models: A Real World Study","  Background and Objectives: We aim to establish deep learning models to
optimize the individualized energy delivery for septic patients. Methods and
Study Design: We conducted a study of adult septic patients in Intensive Care
Unit (ICU), collecting 47 indicators for 14 days. After data cleaning and
preprocessing, we used stats to explore energy delivery in deceased and
surviving patients. We filtered out nutrition-related features and divided the
data into three metabolic phases: acute early, acute late, and rehabilitation.
Models were built using data before September 2020 and validated on the rest.
We then established optimal energy target models for each phase using deep
learning. Results: A total of 277 patients and 3115 data were included in this
study. The models indicated that the optimal energy targets in the three phases
were 900kcal/d, 2300kcal/d, and 2000kcal/d, respectively. Excessive energy
intake increased mortality rapidly in the early period of the acute phase.
Insufficient energy in the late period of the acute phase significantly raised
the mortality of septic patients. For the rehabilitation phase, too much or too
little energy delivery both associated with high mortality. Conclusion: Our
study established time-series prediction models for septic patients to optimize
energy delivery in the ICU. This approach indicated the feasibility of
developing nutritional tools for critically ill patients. We recommended
permissive underfeeding only in the early acute phase. Later, increased energy
intake may improve survival and settle energy debts caused by underfeeding.

automation, allowing for systematic and highly complex DNA assembly. Golden
Gate cloning relies on Type IIS enzymes that cleave an adjacent undefined
sequence motif at a defined distance from the directed enzyme recognition
motif. This feature has been used to define hierarchical Golden Gate assembly
standards with defined overhangs (""fusion sites"") for defined part libraries.
The simplest Golden Gate standard would consist of three part libraries, namely
promoter, coding and terminator sequences, respectively. Each library would
have defined fusion sites, allowing a hierarchical Golden Gate assembly to
generate transcription units. Typically, Type IIS enzymes are used, which
generate four nucleotide overhangs. This results in small scar sequences in
hierarchical DNA assemblies, which can affect the functionality of
transcription units. However, there are enzymes that generate three nucleotide
overhangs, such as SapI. Here we provide a step-by-step protocol on how to use
SapI to assemble transcription units using the start and stop codon for
scarless transcription unit assembly. The protocol also provides guidance on
how to perform multi-gene Golden Gate assemblies with the resulting
transcription units using the Modular Cloning standard. The transcription units
expressing fluorophores are used as an example.

  Australian-grown horticultural commodities","  Australian agriculture supplies many horticultural commodities to domestic
and international markets; however, food composition data for many commodities
are outdated or unavailable. We produced an up-to-date, nationally
representative dataset of up to 148 nutrients and related components in 92
Australian-grown fruit (fresh n=39, dried n=6), vegetables (n=43) and nuts
(n=4) by replacing outdated data (pre-2000), confirming concentrations of
important nutrients and retaining relevant existing data. Primary samples (n =
902) were purchased during peak growing season in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth
between June 2021 and May 2022. While new data reflect current growing
practices, varieties, climate and analytical methods, few notable differences
were found between old and new data where methods of analysis are comparable.
The new data will be incorporated into the Australian Food Composition
Database, allowing free online access to stakeholders. The approach used could
serve as a model for cost-effective updates of national food composition

2402.10245,2024-02-19,Brief overview on Bacteriophage therapy; Alternative to Antibiotics,"  The term bacteriophage means killer or eater of bacteria. They were initially
discovered by F.W. Twort and later on, Felix d'Herelle unveiled them to the
world in 1910. Phage therapy has arisen as a favorable option to conventional
antibiotics by reducing the multinational problem of increasing antibacterial
resistance. These virulent viruses particularly prey on and contaminate
bacterial strains and aid in fighting bacterial diseases. Researchers are
performing various clinical trials on the bacteriophage to tackle pathogenic
bacterial infections, varying from typical illnesses to highly invulnerable
biofilms that cannot be treated with antibiotics. The primary experiments
demonstrated that phage therapy has fewer consequences than traditional
antimicrobial drugs. It is safer to use and show results within a few days.
Although phage therapy has a wide range of promising results, but it also
encounters diverse obstacles. One is that they are host-specific and can merely
be used for personalized therapy. As thousands of bacteria can cause disease,
clinicians have to construct a library of phage viruses. For successful
treatment, an analysis of versatility, stability, and immune interference
related to bacteriophage is necessary. Phage therapy is an excellent substitute
for antibiotics as it illustrates a living base for the treatment of infections
and it is climate-friendly. It only targets the pathogenic cells and has less
influence on the normal microbiota. Regardless of the challenges and problems,
phage therapy is approved as a beneficial approach to combating contagious
infections.

  to user community","  Multimodal neuroimaging grants a powerful in vivo window into the structure
and function of the human brain. Recent methodological and conceptual advances
have enabled investigations of the interplay between large-scale spatial
trends, or gradients, in brain structure and function, offering a framework to
unify principles of brain organization across multiple scales. Strong community
enthusiasm for these techniques has been instrumental in their widespread
adoption and implementation to answer key questions in neuroscience. Following
a brief review of current literature on this framework, this perspective paper
will highlight how pragmatic steps aiming to make gradient methods more
accessible to the community propelled these techniques to the forefront of
neuroscientific inquiry. More specifically, we will emphasize how interest for
gradient methods was catalyzed by data sharing, open-source software
development, as well as the organization of dedicated workshops led by a
diverse team of early career researchers. To this end, we argue that the
growing excitement for brain gradients is the result of coordinated and
consistent efforts to build an inclusive community and can serve as a case in
point for future innovations and conceptual advances in neuroinformatics. We
close this perspective paper by discussing challenges for the continuous
refinement of neuroscientific theory, methodological innovation, and real-world
translation to maintain our collective progress towards integrated models of
brain organization.

misunderstanding of how to estimate the affinity and efficacy of an agonist.
These properties are inextricably linked and cannot be easily separated in any

for receptor agonists have no straightforward interpretation. This problem, the
affinity-efficacy problem, remains overlooked and misunderstood despite it

factors that affect disease risk and treatment responses within the population.
The success of the genomics era and recent widespread availability of
electronic health records (EHR) has ushered in a new wave of genomic biobanks
connected to EHR databases (EHR-linked biobanks). This perspective aims to
discuss how race, ethnicity, and genetic ancestry are currently utilized to
study common disease variation through genetic association studies. Although
genetic ancestry plays a significant role in shaping the genetic landscape
underlying disease risk in humans, the overall risk of a disease is caused by a
complex combination of environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors. When
using EHR-linked biobanks to interrogate underlying disease etiology, it is
also important to be aware of how the biases associated with commonly used
descent-associated concepts such as race and ethnicity can propagate to
downstream analyses. We intend for this resource to support researchers who
perform or analyze genetic association studies in the EHR-linked biobank
setting such as those involved in consortium-wide biobanking efforts. We
provide background on how race, ethnicity, and genetic ancestry play a role in
current association studies, highlight considerations where there is no
consensus about best practices, and provide transparency about the current
shortcomings.

immunochromatographic assays are commonly used but these laboratory tests are
laborious, expensive and might be subjected to cross-reaction and
contamination. Modern optical spectroscopic techniques offer a promising
alternative as they are label-free, sensitive, rapid, non-destructive, and
demonstrate the potential for incorporation into an autonomous system for
disease detection in citrus orchards. Nevertheless, the majority of optical
spectroscopic methods for citrus disease detection are still in the trial
phases and, require additional efforts to be established as efficient and
commercially viable methods. The review presents an overview of fundamental
working principles, the state of the art, and explains the applications and
limitations of the optical spectroscopy technique including the spectroscopic
imaging approach (hyperspectral imaging) in the identification of diseases in
citrus plants. The review highlights (1) the technical specifications of
optical spectroscopic tools that can potentially be utilized in field

  Study Design and Setting: A systematic search was conducted in June 2021 on
PubMed to identify COVID-19-related studies that use the PSM analysis between
2020 and 2021. Key information about study design and PSM analysis were
extracted, such as covariates, matching algorithm, and reporting of estimated
treatment effect type.
  Results: One-hundred-and-fifty (87.72%) cohort studies and thirteen (7.60%)
case-control studies were found among 171 identified articles. Forty-five
studies (26.32%) provided a reasonable justification for covariates selection.
One-hundred-and-three (60.23%) and Sixty-nine (40.35%) studies did not provide
the model that was used for calculating the propensity score or did not report
the matching algorithm, respectively. Seventy-three (42.69%) studies reported
the method(s) for checking covariates balance. Forty studies (23.39%) had a
statistician co-author. All the case-control studies (n=13) did not have a
statistician co-author (p=0.006) and all studies that clarified the treatment
effect estimation (n=6) had a statistician co-author (p<0.001).
  Conclusions: The reporting quality of the PSM analysis is suboptimal in some
COVID-19 epidemiological studies. Some pitfalls may undermine study findings
that involve PSM analysis, such as a mismatch between PSM analysis and study
design.

GenomeBits, is presented. This is based on traditional signal processing
methods such as Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). GenomeBits can be used to
extract underlying genomics features from the distribution of nucleotides, and
can be further used to analyze the mutation patterns in viral genomes. Examples
of the main GenomeBits findings outlining the intrinsic signal organization of
genomics sequences for different SARS-CoV-2 variants along the pandemic years
2020-2022 and Monkeypox cases in 2021 are presented to show the usefulness of
GenomeBits. GenomeBits results for DFT of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in different
geographical regions are discussed together with the GenomeBits analysis of
complete genome sequences for the first coronavirus variants reported: Alpha,
Beta, Gamma, Epsilon and Eta. Interesting features of the Delta and Omicron
variants in the form of a unique ""order-disorder"" transition are uncovered from
these samples as well as from their cumulative distribution function and
scatter plots. This class of transitions might reveal the cumulative outcome of
mutations on the spike protein. A salient feature of GenomeBits is the mapping
of the nucleotide bases (A,T,C,G) into an alternating spin-like numerical
sequence via a series having binary (0,1) indicators for each A,T,C,G. This
leads to derive a set of statistical distribution curves. Furthermore, the
quantum-based extension of the GenomeBits model to an analogous probability
measure is shown to identify properties of genome sequences as wavefunctions
via a superposition of states. An association of the integral of the GenomeBits
coding and a binding-like energy can in principle also be established. The
relevance of these different results in Bioinformatics is analyzed.

Despite guidelines promoting equal participation, females are underrepresented
in exercise science, perpetuating misconceptions about female physiology. Even
less attention has been given to exercise in the pregnant population. Research
on pregnancy and exercise has evolved considerably from the initial bedrest
prescriptions but concerns about exercise risks during pregnancy persisted for
many decades. Recent guidelines endorse moderate-intensity physical activity
during pregnancy, supported by considerable evidence of its safety and
benefits. Mental health during pregnancy, often overlooked, is gaining
traction, with exercise showing promise in reducing depression and anxiety.
While pregnancy guidelines recommend moderate-intensity physical activity,
there remains limited understanding of optimal frequency, intensity, type and
time (duration) for extremes like elite athletes or those with complications.
Female participation in elite sport and physically demanding jobs is rising,
but research on their specific needs is lacking. Traditional practices like bed
rest for high-risk pregnancies are being questioned, as evidence suggests it
may not improve outcomes. Historical neglect of gestational parents in research
perpetuated stereotypes of female frailty, but recent years have seen a shift
towards recognizing the benefits of an active pregnancy. Closing knowledge gaps
and inclusivity in research are crucial for ensuring guidelines reflect the
diverse needs of gestational parents. Therefore, the purpose of this review is
to summarize the evolution of exercise physiology and pregnancy research along

frameworks based on transient dynamics away from attractors are better suited
for the description of computations performed by neuronal and signaling

target (n=70) was reached. 87% completed at least one module and 57% completed
the full program (five modules). The median interest/enjoyment rating was 5 out
of 7 and median value/usefulness rating was 6 out of 7 (where 7 = very true).
Compared to pre-program, participants who completed any of the program had
statistically significantly improved DHQ, CNLT, and FLBC scores. Conclusion:
Eating Well with MS was well received by the MS community and improved their
dietary behaviours; demonstrating feasibility. Our findings support the use of
co-design methods when developing resources to improve dietary behaviours.

  people with multiple sclerosis: a qualitative study","  Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex immune-mediated disease with
no currently known cure. There is growing evidence to support the role of diet
in reducing some of the symptoms and disease progression in MS, and we
previously developed and tested the feasibility of a digital nutrition
education program for people with MS. Objective The aim of this study was to
explore factors that influenced engagement in the digital nutrition education
program, including features influencing capability, opportunity, and motivation
to change their dietary behaviours. Methods Semi-structured interviews were
conducted with people who MS who completed some or all of the program, until
data saturation was reached. Interviews were analysed inductively using
thematic analysis. Themes were deductively mapped against the COM-B behaviour
change model. Results 16 interviews were conducted with participants who
completed all (n=10) or some of the program (n=6). Four themes emerged: 1)
Acquiring and validating nutrition knowledge; 2) Influence of time and social
support; 3) Getting in early to improve health; and 4) Accounting for food
literacy experiences. Discussion This is the first online nutrition program
with suitable behavioural supports for people with MS. It highlights the
importance of disease-specific and evidence-based nutrition education to
support people with MS to make dietary changes. Acquiring nutrition knowledge,
coupled with practical support mechanisms such as recipe booklets and
goal-setting, emerged as crucial for facilitating engagement with the program.
Conclusions When designing education programs for people with MS and other
neurological conditions, healthcare professionals and program designers should
consider flexible delivery and building peer support to address the needs and
challenges faced by participants.

  papers","  As AI promises to accelerate scientific discovery, it remains unclear whether
fully AI-driven research is possible and whether it can adhere to key
scientific values, such as transparency, traceability and verifiability.
Mimicking human scientific practices, we built data-to-paper, an automation
platform that guides interacting LLM agents through a complete stepwise
research process, while programmatically back-tracing information flow and
allowing human oversight and interactions. In autopilot mode, provided with
annotated data alone, data-to-paper raised hypotheses, designed research plans,
wrote and debugged analysis codes, generated and interpreted results, and
created complete and information-traceable research papers. Even though
research novelty was relatively limited, the process demonstrated autonomous
generation of de novo quantitative insights from data. For simple research
goals, a fully-autonomous cycle can create manuscripts which recapitulate
peer-reviewed publications without major errors in about 80-90%, yet as goal
complexity increases, human co-piloting becomes critical for assuring accuracy.
Beyond the process itself, created manuscripts too are inherently verifiable,
as information-tracing allows to programmatically chain results, methods and
data. Our work thereby demonstrates a potential for AI-driven acceleration of
scientific discovery while enhancing, rather than jeopardizing, traceability,
transparency and verifiability.

rapidly accelerating the pace of biological discovery and engineering. AI
techniques, such as large language models and biological design tools, are
enabling the automated design, build, test, and learning cycles for engineered
biological systems. This convergence promises to democratize synthetic biology
and unlock novel applications across domains from medicine to environmental
sustainability. However, it also poses significant risks around reliability,
dual use, and governance. The opacity of AI models, the deskilling of
workforces, and the outdated nature of current regulatory frameworks present
challenges in ensuring responsible development. Urgent attention is needed to
update governance structures, integrate human oversight into increasingly
automated workflows, and foster a culture of responsibility among the growing
community of bioengineers. Only by proactively addressing these issues can we
realize the transformative potential of AI-driven synthetic biology while

  scale for Chinese College Students","  Medication literacy is integral to health literacy, pivotal for medication
safety and adherence. It denotes an individual's capacity to discern,
comprehend, and convey medication-related information. Existing scales,
however, are time-consuming and predominantly cater to patients and community
dwellers, necessitating a more succinct instrument. This study presents the
development of a brief Medication Literacy Scale (MLS-14) utilizing classical
test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT), targeting a college student
demographic. The MLS-14's abbreviated version, a 6-item scale (MLS-SF), was
distilled through CTT and IRT methodologies, engaging 2431 Chinese college
students to scrutinize its psychometric properties. The MLS-SF demonstrated a
Cronbach's {\alpha} of 0.765, with three extracted factors via exploratory
factor analysis, accounting for 66% of the cumulative variance. All items
exhibited factor loadings above 0.5. The scale's three-factor structure was
substantiated through confirmatory factor analysis with satisfactory fit
indices (chi2/df=5.11, RMSEA=0.063, GFI=0.990, AGFI=0.966, NFI=0.984,
IFI=0.987, CFI=0.987). IRT modeling confirmed reasonable discrimination and
location parameters for all items, free of differential item functioning (DIF)
by gender. Except for items 4 and 10, the remaining items were informative at
medium theta levels, indicating their utility in assessing medication literacy
efficiently. The developed 6-item Medication Literacy Short Form (MLS-SF)
proves to be a reliable and valid instrument for the expedited evaluation of
college students' medication literacy, offering a valuable addition to the
arsenal of health literacy assessment tools.

2405.06457,2024-05-13,"Characterization of mood and emotion regulation in females with PMS/PMDD
  using near-infrared spectroscopy to assess prefrontal cerebral blood flow and
  the mood questionnaire","  Many sexually mature women experience premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or
premenstrual dysphoric mood disorder (PMDD). Current approaches for managing
PMS and PMDD rely on daily mental condition recording, which many discontinue
due to its impracticality. Hence, there's a critical need for a simple,
objective method to monitor mental symptoms. One of the principal symptoms of
PMDD is a dysfunction in emotional regulation, which has been demonstrated
through brain-function imaging measurements to involve hyperactivity in the
amygdala and a decrease in functionality in the prefrontal cortex (PFC).
However, most research has been focused on PMDD, leaving a gap in understanding
of PMS. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measures brain activity by
spectroscopically determining the amount of hemoglobin in the blood vessels.
This study aimed to characterize the emotional regulation function in PMS. We
measured brain activity in the PFC region using NIRS when participants were
presented with emotion-inducing pictures. Furthermore, moods highly associated
with emotions were assessed through questionnaires. Forty-six participants were
categorized into non-PMS, PMS, and PMDD groups based on the gynecologist's
diagnosis. POMS2 scores revealed higher negative mood and lower positive mood
in the follicular phase for the PMS group, while the PMDD group exhibited
heightened negative mood during the luteal phase. NIRS results showed reduced
emotional expression in the PMS group during both phases, while no significant
differences were observed in the PMDD group compared to non-PMS. It was found
that there are differences in the distribution of mood during the luteal and
follicular phase and in cerebral blood flow responses to emotional stimuli
between PMS and PMDD. These findings suggest the potential for providing
individuals with awareness of PMS or PMDD through scores on the POMS2 and NIRS
measurements.

because of their high incidence, public health burden, and clinically
significant disease spectrum. These vector-borne disease causes one-fourth of
annual deaths, leading to various infectious diseases. The arbovirus represents
eight different families and 14 genera; most viruses belong to the family
Bunyaviridae, and some also belong to Togaviridae, Reoviridae, and
Flaviviridae. The arbovirus disease was isolated first in tropical and
subtropical regions of South America and Africa and has high significance
because of suitable environmental conditions for virus transmission and vector
expansion. Its transmission cycle ranges from simple to highly complex. DENV is
the most prevalent, results in febrile illness, and has transmission in 128
different countries. CHIKV causes infection in asymptomatic people, and the
problems include nephritis, arthritis, myelitis, and acute encephalopathy.
ZIKV-infected 80% of people are asymptomatic and may cause rashes, myalgia,
fever, headache, and conjunctivitis. Vaccines for DENV are not clinically

2405.09595,2024-05-17,Simplicity within biological complexity,"  Heterogeneous, interconnected, systems-level, molecular data have become
increasingly available and key in precision medicine. We need to utilize them
to better stratify patients into risk groups, discover new biomarkers and
targets, repurpose known and discover new drugs to personalize medical
treatment. Existing methodologies are limited and a paradigm shift is needed to
achieve quantitative and qualitative breakthroughs. In this perspective paper,
we survey the literature and argue for the development of a comprehensive,
general framework for embedding of multi-scale molecular network data that
would enable their explainable exploitation in precision medicine in linear
time. Network embedding methods map nodes to points in low-dimensional space,
so that proximity in the learned space reflects the network's topology-function
relationships. They have recently achieved unprecedented performance on hard
problems of utilizing few omic data in various biomedical applications.
However, research thus far has been limited to special variants of the problems
and data, with the performance depending on the underlying topology-function
network biology hypotheses, the biomedical applications and evaluation metrics.
The availability of multi-omic data, modern graph embedding paradigms and
compute power call for a creation and training of efficient, explainable and
controllable models, having no potentially dangerous, unexpected behaviour,
that make a qualitative breakthrough. We propose to develop a general,
comprehensive embedding framework for multi-omic network data, from models to
efficient and scalable software implementation, and to apply it to biomedical
informatics. It will lead to a paradigm shift in computational and biomedical
understanding of data and diseases that will open up ways to solving some of
the major bottlenecks in precision medicine and other domains.

2405.11009,2024-05-21,Petri nets in modelling glucose regulating processes in the liver,"  Diabetes is a chronic condition, considered one of the civilization diseases,
that is characterized by sustained high blood sugar levels. There is no doubt
that more and more people is going to suffer from diabetes, hence it is crucial
to understand better its biological foundations. The essential processes
related to the control of glucose levels in the blood are: glycolysis (process
of breaking down of glucose) and glucose synthesis, both taking place in the
liver. The glycolysis occurs during feeding and it is stimulated by insulin. On
the other hand, the glucose synthesis arises during fasting and it is
stimulated by glucagon. In the paper we present a Petri net model of glycolysis
and glucose synthesis in the liver. The model is created based on medical
literature. Standard Petri nets techniques are used to analyse the properties
of the model: traps, reachability graphs, tokens dynamics, deadlocks analysis.
The results are described in the paper. Our analysis shows that the model
captures the interactions between different enzymes and substances, which is
consistent with the biological processes occurring during fasting and feeding.
The model constitutes the first element of our long-time goal to create the
whole body model of the glucose regulation in a healthy human and a person with
diabetes.

  Cyanobacteria under Simulated Illumination from a K Dwarf Star","  Stars with about 45 to 80% the mass of the Sun, so-called K dwarf stars, have
previously been proposed as optimal host stars in the search for habitable
extrasolar worlds. These stars are abundant, have stable luminosities over
billions of years longer than Sun-like stars, and offer favorable space
environmental conditions. So far, the theoretical and experimental focus on
exoplanet habitability has been on even less massive, though potentially less
hospitable red dwarf stars. Here we present the first experimental data on the
responses of photosynthetic organisms to a simulated K dwarf spectrum. We find
that garden cress Lepidium sativum under K-dwarf radiation exhibits comparable
growth and photosynthetic efficiency as under solar illumination on Earth. The
cyanobacterium Chroococcidiopsis sp. CCMEE 029 exhibits significantly higher
photosynthetic efficiency and culture growth under K dwarf radiation compared
to solar conditions. Our findings of the affirmative responses of these two
photosynthetic organisms to K dwarf radiation suggest that exoplanets in the
habitable zones around such stars deserve high priority in the search for
extrasolar life.

2405.19936,2024-05-31,Free-ranging dogs quickly learn to recognize a rewarding person,"  Individual human recognition is important for species that live in close
proximity to humans. Numerous studies on domesticated species and urban-adapted
birds have highlighted this ability. One such species which is heavily reliant
on humans is the free-ranging dog. Very little knowledge exists on the amount
of time taken by free-ranging dogs to learn and remember individual humans. Due
to their territorial nature, they have a high probability of encountering the
same people multiple times on the streets. Being able to distinguish individual
humans might be helpful in making decisions regarding people from whom to beg
for food or social reward. We investigated if free-ranging dogs are capable of
identifying the person rewarding them and the amount of time required for them
to learn it. We conducted field trials on randomly selected adult free-ranging
dogs in West Bengal, India. On Day 1, a choice test was conducted. The
experimenter chosen did not provide reward while the other experimenter
provided a piece of boiled chicken followed by petting. The person giving
reward on Day 1 served as the correct choice on four subsequent days of
training. Day 6 was the test day when none of the experimenters had a reward.
We analyzed the choice made by the dogs, the time taken to approach during the
choice tests, and the socialization index, which was calculated based on the
intensity of affiliative behaviour shown towards the experimenters. The dogs
made correct choices at a significantly higher rate on the fifth and sixth
days, as compared to Day 2, suggesting learning. This is the first study aiming
to understand the time taken for individual human recognition in free-ranging
dogs and can serve as the scaffold for future studies to understand the
dog-human relationship in open environments, like urban ecosystems.

basis for diabetes breath analysis. This provides a more readily accepted
method for early diabetes prevention and monitoring. Addressing issues such as
the invasive nature, disease transmission risks, and complexity of diabetes
testing, this study aims to design a diabetes gas biomarker acetone detection
system centered around a sensor array using gas sensors and pattern recognition
algorithms. The research covers sensor selection, sensor preparation, circuit
design, data acquisition and processing, and detection model establishment to
accurately identify acetone. Titanium dioxide was chosen as the nano
gas-sensitive material to prepare the acetone gas sensor, with data collection
conducted using STM32. Filtering was applied to process the raw sensor data,
followed by feature extraction using principal component analysis. A
recognition model based on support vector machine algorithm was used for
qualitative identification of gas samples, while a recognition model based on
backpropagation neural network was employed for quantitative detection of gas
sample concentrations. Experimental results demonstrated recognition accuracies
of 96% and 97.5% for acetone-ethanol and acetone-methanol mixed gases, and 90%
for ternary acetone, ethanol, and methanol mixed gases.

  Standardization","  Background: Limited universally-adopted data standards in veterinary medicine
hinder data interoperability and therefore integration and comparison; this
ultimately impedes the application of existing information-based tools to
support advancement in diagnostics, treatments, and precision medicine.
  Objectives: A single, coherent, logic-based standard for documenting breed
names in health, production, and research-related records will improve data use
capabilities in veterinary and comparative medicine. Methods: The Vertebrate
Breed Ontology (VBO) was created from breed names and related information
compiled from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,
breed registries, communities, and experts, using manual and computational
approaches. Each breed is represented by a VBO term that includes breed
information and provenance as metadata. VBO terms are classified using
description logic to allow computational applications and Artificial
Intelligence-readiness.
  Results: VBO is an open, community-driven ontology representing over 19,500
livestock and companion animal breed concepts covering 49 species. Breeds are
classified based on community and expert conventions (e.g., cattle breed) and
supported by relations to the breed's genus and species indicated by National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Taxonomy terms. Relationships
between VBO terms (e.g., relating breeds to their foundation stock) provide
additional context to support advanced data analytics. VBO term metadata
includes synonyms, breed identifiers/codes, and attributed cross-references to
other databases.
  Conclusion and clinical importance: The adoption of VBO as a source of
standard breed names in databases and veterinary electronic health records can
enhance veterinary data interoperability and computability.

2406.05170,2024-06-11,Research on Tumors Segmentation based on Image Enhancement Method,"  One of the most effective ways to treat liver cancer is to perform precise
liver resection surgery, the key step of which includes precise digital image
segmentation of the liver and its tumor. However, traditional liver parenchymal
segmentation techniques often face several challenges in performing liver
segmentation: lack of precision, slow processing speed, and computational
burden. These shortcomings limit the efficiency of surgical planning and
execution. In this work, the model initially describes in detail a new image
enhancement algorithm that enhances the key features of an image by adaptively
adjusting the contrast and brightness of the image. Then, a deep learning-based
segmentation network was introduced, which was specially trained on the
enhanced images to optimize the detection accuracy of tumor regions. In
addition, multi-scale analysis techniques have been incorporated into the
study, allowing the model to analyze images at different resolutions to capture
more nuanced tumor features. In the presentation of the experimental results,
the study used the 3Dircadb dataset to test the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional image
segmentation method, the new method using image enhancement technology has
significantly improved the accuracy and recall rate of tumor identification.

2406.06826,2024-06-12,"Experimental Measurement of Assembly Indices are Required to Determine
  The Threshold for Life","  Assembly Theory (AT) was developed to help distinguish living from non-living
systems. The theory is simple as it posits that the amount of selection or
Assembly is a function of the number of complex objects where their complexity
can be objectively determined using assembly indices. The assembly index of a
given object relates to the number of recursive joining operations required to
build that object and can be not only rigorously defined mathematically but can
be experimentally measured. In pervious work we outlined the theoretical basis,
but also extensive experimental measurements that demonstrated the predictive
power of AT. These measurements showed that is a threshold in assembly indices
for organic molecules whereby abiotic chemical systems could not randomly
produce molecules with an assembly index greater or equal than 15. In a recent
paper by Hazen et al [1] the authors not only confused the concept of AT with
the algorithms used to calculate assembly indices, but also attempted to
falsify AT by calculating theoretical assembly indices for objects made from
inorganic building blocks. A fundamental misunderstanding made by the authors
is that the threshold is a requirement of the theory, rather than experimental
observation. This means that exploration of inorganic assembly indices
similarly requires an experimental observation, correlated with the theoretical
calculations. Then and only then can the exploration of complex inorganic
molecules be done using AT and the threshold for living systems, as expressed
with such building blocks, be determined. Since Hazen et al.[1] present no
experimental measurements of assembly theory, their analysis is not
falsifiable.

vector control is widely believed to be the most effective form of managing
outbreaks. This study examines traditional state space models (moving average,
autoregressive, ARIMA, SARIMA), supervised learning techniques (XGBoost, SVM,
KNN) and deep networks (LSTM, CNN, ConvLSTM) for forecasting weekly dengue
cases in Singapore. Meteorological data and search engine trends were included
as features for ML techniques. Forecasts using CNNs yielded lowest RMSE in
weekly cases in 2019.

2407.00408,2024-07-02,"Rooting behavior of pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) hardwood cuttings
  in relation to genotype and irrigation frequency","  The study was conducted to determine the best irrigation frequency for
rooting hardwood cuttings of some pomegranate genotypes that are cultivated in
Halabja province, Kurdistan Region, Iraq. The hardwood cuttings were collected
from 11 genotypes, which were 'Salakhani Trsh' (G1), 'Salakhani Mekhosh' (G2),
'Amriki' (G3), 'Twekl Sury Trsh' (G4), 'Twekl Astury Naw Spy' (G5), 'Hanara
Sherina' (G6), 'Kawa Hanary Sherin' (G7), 'Kawa Hanary Trsh' (G8), 'Malesay
Twekl Asture' (G9), 'Malesay Twekl Tank' (G10), and 'Sura Hanary Trsh' (G11).
The genotypes were subjected to irrigation applications by 1-day, 2-day, 7-day,
or 10-day frequencies. Among pomegranates, G11, G6, and G7 produced 95, 90, and
83% rooting percentages, which were significantly higher than the rest of other
genotypes. The lowest rooting percentages (28, 36, 38, and 40%) were found in
G1, G5, G3, and G10, respectively. The effect of irrigation frequencies on the
genotypes confirmed that a 7-day frequency was the best irrigation frequency to
achieve the maximum rooting percentages (93, 86, 80, 73, 53, and 40%) in G6,
G9, G2, G4, G3, and G1, respectively. In contrast, the minimum rooting
percentage (20%) was recorded in G3 with a 1-day frequency and in G1 with
10-day frequency. In this study, it was found that the cuttings of G11, G6, and
G7 had the best ability to form roots, and irrigation with a 7-day frequency
was the best for the cuttings of all the 11 pomegranate genotypes investigated.

2407.00420,2024-07-02,"Cement Dust Exposure and Risk of Hyperglycemia and Overweight among
  Artisans and Residents Close to a Cement Factory in Sokoto, Nigeria","  The potential health risks of cement dust exposure are increasingly raising
concern worldwide as the cement industry expands in response to rising cement
demand. This necessitates the need to determine the nature of the risks in
order to develop appropriate measures. This study determined the effects of
cement dust exposure on the weight and blood glucose levels of people residing
or working around a cement company in Sokoto, Nigeria. Demographic information
was obtained using questionnaires from 72 participants, which included age,
gender, educational level, exposure hours, occupation, and lifestyle. The blood
glucose levels and body mass index (BMI) were measured using a Fine Test
glucometer and a mechanical scale, respectively. The results showed that most
of the people living or working around the cement company were middle-aged men
(31-40; 42.06%) with a primary (33.33%) or secondary (45.83%) school education.
It showed that 30 (41.69%) of the participants were overweight while 5 (6.94%)
were obese. Additionally, 52.78% of the participants were diabetic while 31.94%
were prediabetic. Participants that were exposed for long hours (> 15 hours per
day) were the most diabetic (20% of the participants), followed by smokers
(15%), and artisans (7%). It can be concluded that exposure to cement dust from
the company increased the risk of overweight, obesity, and hyperglycemia among
the participants. These health risks were worsened by daily long hours of
exposure, smoking, and artisanal pollutant exposure. Human settlements and
artisans should not be located near the cement company, and the company should
minimize pollutant emissions.

  intelligence for drug discovery","  Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) is exhibiting tremendous potential
to reduce the massive costs and long timescales of drug discovery. There are
however important challenges currently limiting the impact and scope of AI
models.
  Areas covered: In this perspective, the authors discuss a range of data
issues (bias, inconsistency, skewness, irrelevance, small size, high
dimensionality), how they challenge AI models, and which issue-specific
mitigations have been effective. Next, they point out the challenges faced by
uncertainty quantification techniques aimed at enhancing and trusting the
predictions from these AI models. They also discuss how conceptual errors,
unrealistic benchmarks and performance misestimation can confound the
evaluation of models and thus their development. Lastly, the authors explain
how human bias, whether from AI experts or drug discovery experts, constitutes
another challenge that can be alleviated by gaining more prospective
experience.
  Expert opinion: AI models are often developed to excel on retrospective
benchmarks unlikely to anticipate their prospective performance. As a result,
only a few of these models are ever reported to have prospective value (e.g. by
discovering potent and innovative drug leads for a therapeutic target). The
authors have discussed what can go wrong in practice with AI for drug
discovery. We hope that this will help inform the decisions of editors, funders
investors and researchers working in this area.

2407.06211,2024-07-10,Synthetic data: How could it be used for infectious disease research?,"  Over the last three to five years, it has become possible to generate machine
learning synthetic data for healthcare-related uses. However, concerns have
been raised about potential negative factors associated with the possibilities
of artificial dataset generation. These include the potential misuse of
generative artificial intelligence (AI) in fields such as cybercrime, the use
of deepfakes and fake news to deceive or manipulate, and displacement of human
jobs across various market sectors.
  Here, we consider both current and future positive advances and possibilities
with synthetic datasets. Synthetic data offers significant benefits,
particularly in data privacy, research, in balancing datasets and reducing bias
in machine learning models. Generative AI is an artificial intelligence genre
capable of creating text, images, video or other data using generative models.
The recent explosion of interest in GenAI was heralded by the invention and
speedy move to use of large language models (LLM). These computational models
are able to achieve general-purpose language generation and other natural
language processing tasks and are based on transformer architectures, which
made an evolutionary leap from previous neural network architectures.
  Fuelled by the advent of improved GenAI techniques and wide scale usage, this
is surely the time to consider how synthetic data can be used to advance
infectious disease research. In this commentary we aim to create an overview of
the current and future position of synthetic data in infectious disease
research.

2407.06478,2024-09-10,Automated Chronotyping from a Daily Calendar using Machine Learning,"  Chronotype compares individuals' circadian phase to others. It contextualizes
mental health risk assessments and detection of social jet lag, which can
hamper mental health and cognitive performance. Existing ways of determining
chronotypes, such as Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO) or the
Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), are limited by being discrete in
time and time-intensive to update, meaning they rarely capture real-world
variability across time. Chronotyping users based on a daily planner app might
augment existing methods to enable assessment continuously and at scale. This
paper reports the construction of a supervised binary classifier that attempts
to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. 1,460 registered users from
the Owaves app opted in by filling out the MEQ survey between July 14, 2022,
and May 1, 2023. 142 met the eligibility criteria. We used multimodal app data
from individuals identified as morning and evening types from MEQ data, basing
the classifier on app time series data. This included daily timing for 8 main
lifestyle activity types: exercise, sleep, social interactions, meal times,
relaxation, work, play, and miscellaneous, as defined in the app. The timing of
activities showed substantial change across time, as well as heterogeneity by
activity type. Our novel chronotyping classifier was able to predict the
morningness and eveningness of its users with an ROC AUC of 0.70. Our findings
demonstrate the feasibility of chronotype classification from multimodal,
real-world app data, while highlighting fundamental challenges to applying
discrete and fixed labels to complex, dynamic, multimodal behaviors. Our
findings suggest a potential for real-time monitoring of shifts in chronotype
specific to different causes (i.e. types of activity), which could feasibly be
used to support future, prospective mental health support research.

  SIR Component Models","  Petri nets are a promising modeling framework for epidemiology, including the
spread of disease across populations or within an individual. In particular,
the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartment model is foundational
for population epidemiological modeling and has been implemented in several
prior Petri net studies. However, the SIR model is generally stated as a system
of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with continuous time and variables,
while Petri nets are discrete event simulations. To our knowledge, no prior
study has investigated the numerical equivalence of Petri net SIR models to the
classical ODE formulation. We introduce crucial numerical techniques for
implementing SIR models in the GPenSim package for Petri net simulations. We
show that these techniques are critical for Petri net SIR models and show a
relative root mean squared error of less than 1% compared to ODE simulations
for biologically relevant parameter ranges. We conclude that Petri nets provide
a valid framework for modeling SIR-type dynamics using biologically relevant
parameter values provided that the other PN structures we outline are also
implemented.

  peoples in Australia","  Background/Objective: Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
[25(OH)D] concentration <50 nmol/L) is prevalent among Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander peoples in Australia. Alternative to sun exposure (the primary
source of vitamin D), vitamin D can also be obtained from food (e.g., fish,
eggs, and meat) and supplements. However, vitamin D intake among Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander peoples is currently unknown. We aimed to provide the
first quantification of vitamin D intake using nationally representative data
from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Methods: We used food
consumption data collected in the 2012-2013 National Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (n = 4,109) and vitamin
D food composition data to quantify mean absolute vitamin D intake by sex, age
group, and remoteness of location. Differences in mean vitamin D intake between
sexes and between remoteness of location were assessed using the 95% confidence
interval (95% CI). Results: The mean (standard deviation (SD)) vitamin D intake
among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples was 2.9 (3.0) {\mu}g/day.
Males had a statistically significantly higher mean (SD) [95% CI] vitamin D
intake (3.2 (3.1) [3.0-3.4] {\mu}g/day) than females (2.6 (2.7) [2.4-2.7]
{\mu}g/day). There were no statistically significant differences between mean
(SD) [95% CI] vitamin D intake in non-remote (2.9 (2.2) [2.7-3.1] {\mu}g/day)
and remote areas (2.8 (4.8) [2.6-3.0] {\mu}g/day). Conclusions: Vitamin D
intake among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is low. Food-based
public health strategies could be developed to promote higher vitamin D intake
among this population.

2407.14556,2025-02-18,Mechanical Self-replication,"  This study presents a theoretical model for a self-replicating mechanical
system inspired by biological processes within living cells and supported by
computer simulations. The model decomposes self-replication into core
components, each of which is executed by a single machine constructed from a
set of basic block types. Key functionalities such as sorting, copying, and
building, are demonstrated. The model provides valuable insights into the
constraints of self-replicating systems. The discussion also addresses the
spatial and timing behavior of the system, as well as its efficiency and

accounts for the complex, distributed genetic architecture of most traits and
the emergent robustness and evolvability of developmental processes, while also
offering a conception that lends itself to formalisation.

2407.17601,2024-07-26,"When Life Gives You Lemons, Squeeze Your Way Through: Understanding
  Citrus Avoidance Behaviour by Free-Ranging Dogs in India","  Palatability of food is driven by multiple factors like taste, smell,
texture, freshness, etc. and can be very variable across species. There are
classic examples of local adaptations leading to speciation, driven by food
availability. Urbanization across the world is causing rapid decline of
biodiversity, while also driving local adaptations in some species.
Free-ranging dogs are an interesting example of adaptation to a human-dominated
environment across varied habitats. They have co-existed with humans for
centuries and are a perfect model system for studying local adaptations. We
attempted to understand a specific aspect of their scavenging behaviour in
India: citrus aversion. Pet dogs are known to avoid citrus fruits and food
contaminated by them. In India, lemons are used widely in the cuisine, and
discarded in the garbage. Hence, free-ranging dogs, that typically are
scavengers of human leftovers, are likely to encounter lemons and
lemon-contaminated food on a regular basis. We carried out a population level
experiment to test response of free-ranging dogs to chicken contaminated with
various parts of lemon. The dogs avoided chicken contaminated with lemon juice
the most. Further, when provided with chicken dipped in three different
concentrations of lemon juice, the lowest concentration was most preferred. A
survey confirmed that the local people use lemon in their diet extensively and
also discard these with the leftovers. People avoided giving citrus
contaminated food to their pets but did not follow the same caution for
free-ranging dogs. This study revealed that free-ranging dogs in West Bengal,
India, are well adapted to scavenging among citrus-contaminated garbage and
have their own strategies to avoid the contamination as far as possible, while
maximizing their preferred food intake.

(serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration < 50 nmol/L) among Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander peoples highlight a need for public health strategies to
improve vitamin D status. As few foods contain naturally occurring vitamin D,
fortification strategies may be needed to improve vitamin D intake and status
among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Objective: We aimed to
model vitamin D food fortification scenarios among Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander peoples. Methods: We used nationally representative food consumption
data (n=4,109) and vitamin D food composition data to model four food
fortification scenarios. The modelling for Scenario 1 included foods and
maximum vitamin D concentrations permitted for fortification in Australia: i)
dairy products and alternatives, ii) butter/margarine/oil spreads, iii)
formulated beverages, and iv) selected ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. The
modelling for Scenarios 2a-c included some vitamin D concentrations higher than
permitted in Australia; Scenario 2c included bread, which is not permitted for
vitamin D fortification in Australia. Scenario 2a: i) dairy products and
alternatives, ii) butter/margarine/oil spreads, iii) formulated beverages.
Scenario 2b: as per Scenario 2a plus selected ready-to-eat breakfast cereals.
Scenario 2c: as per Scenario 2b plus bread. Results: Vitamin D fortification of
a range of staple foods could potentially increase vitamin D intake among
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples by ~ 3-6 {\mu}g/day. Scenario 2c
showed the highest potential median vitamin D intake increase to ~ 8
{\mu}g/day. Across all modelled scenarios, none of the participants had vitamin
D intake above the Australian upper level of intake of 80 {\mu}g/day.

2407.20534,2024-07-31,BERT and LLMs-Based avGFP Brightness Prediction and Mutation Design,"  This study aims to utilize Transformer models and large language models (such
as GPT and Claude) to predict the brightness of Aequorea victoria green
fluorescent protein (avGFP) and design mutants with higher brightness.
Considering the time and cost associated with traditional experimental
screening methods, this study employs machine learning techniques to enhance
research efficiency. We first read and preprocess a proprietary dataset
containing approximately 140,000 protein sequences, including about 30,000
avGFP sequences. Subsequently, we constructed and trained a Transformer-based
prediction model to screen and design new avGFP mutants that are expected to
exhibit higher brightness.
  Our methodology consists of two primary stages: first, the construction of a
scoring model using BERT, and second, the screening and generation of mutants
using mutation site statistics and large language models. Through the analysis
of predictive results, we designed and screened 10 new high-brightness avGFP
sequences. This study not only demonstrates the potential of deep learning in
protein design but also provides new perspectives and methodologies for future
research by integrating prior knowledge from large language models.

2408.00942,2024-11-25,Foundations of a Compositional Systems Biology,"  Composition is a powerful principle for systems biology, focused on the
interfaces, interconnections, and orchestration of distributed processes to
enable integrative multiscale simulations. Whereas traditional models focus on
the structure or dynamics of specific subsystems in controlled conditions,
compositional systems biology aims to connect these models, asking critical
questions about the space between models: What variables should a submodel
expose through its interface? How do coupled models connect and translate
across scales? How do domain-specific models connect across biological and
physical disciplines to drive the synthesis of new knowledge? This approach
requires robust software to integrate diverse datasets and submodels, providing
researchers with tools to flexibly recombine, iteratively refine, and
collaboratively expand their models. This article offers a comprehensive
framework to support this vision, including: a conceptual and graphical
framework to define interfaces and composition patterns; standardized schemas
that facilitate modular data and model assembly; biological templates that
integrate detailed submodels that connect molecular processes to the emergence
of the cellular interface; and user-friendly software interfaces that empower
research communities to construct and improve multiscale models of cellular
systems. By addressing these needs, compositional systems biology will foster a
unified and scalable approach to understanding complex cellular systems.

  application in closed-loop deep brain stimulation","  Objective - This work introduces Dareplane, a modular and broad
technology-agnostic open source software platform for brain-computer interface
research with an application focus on adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS).
One difficulty for investigating control approaches for aDBS resides with the
complex setups required for aDBS experiments, a challenge Dareplane tries to
address. Approach - The key features of the platform are presented and the
composition of modules into a full experimental setup is discussed in the
context of a Python-based orchestration module. The performance of a typical
experimental setup on Dareplane for aDBS is evaluated in three benchtop
experiments, covering (a) an easy-to-replicate setup using an Arduino
microcontroller, (b) a setup with hardware of an implantable pulse generator,
and (c) a setup using an established and CE certified external neurostimulator.
The full technical feasibility of the platform in the aDBS context is
demonstrated in a first closed-loop session with externalized leads on a
patient with Parkinson's disease receiving DBS treatment and further in a
non-invasive BCI speller application using code-modulated visual evoked
responses (c-VEP). Main results - The platform is implemented and open-source
accessible on https://github.com/bsdlab/Dareplane. Benchtop results show that
performance of the platform is sufficient for current aDBS latencies, and the
platform could successfully be used in the aDBS experiment. The timing-critical
c-VEP speller could be successfully implemented on the platform achieving
expected information transfer rates. Significance - The Dareplane platform
supports aDBS setups, and more generally the research on neurotechnological
systems such as brain-computer interfaces. It provides a modular,
technology-agnostic, and easy-to-implement software platform to make
experimental setups more resilient and replicable.

  Rice Chips Used as Mango Fruit Artificial Ripening Agents in Birnin Kebbi,
  Nigeria","  The high demand for mango (Mangifera indica L.) fruits has led sellers to
employ ripening agents. However, concerns are growing regarding the potential
toxicities of induced ripening, emphasizing the need for scientific
investigation. Samples of artificially and naturally ripened mangoes were
analyzed for proximate composition using standard protocols. Cytogenotoxicity
was then assessed using the Allium cepa L. toxicity test. Twenty (20)A. cepa
(onion) bulbs were used, with 5 ripened naturally, 5 with wood ash, 5 with
herbaceous ash, and 5 with rice chips, all grown over tap water for five days.
The root tips of the bulbs were assayed and examined for chromosomal
aberrations. The results revealed a significant (P<0.05) increase in moisture,
protein, and ash content of mangoes as ripening agents were introduced. Mangoes
ripened with wood ash exhibited the highest moisture content (81%), while those
ripened with rice chips had the highest protein (0.5%) and ash content (1.5%).
Naturally ripened mangoes displayed the highest fat (0.0095%) and fiber
(11.46%) contents. The A. cepa toxicity test indicated significant (p<0.05)
differences in the root growth of mangoes ripened with various agents. Wood ash
resulted in the highest root growth (2.62cm), while herbaceous ash had the
least (2.18%). Chromosomal aberrations, including sticky, vagrant, and laggard
abnormalities, were observed in all agents, with herbaceous ash exhibiting the
highest and rice chips the least. The obtained results suggest that induced
ripening of the fruits could induce toxicities, highlighting the necessity for
public awareness regarding the potential dangers posed by these agents.

2408.07142,2024-08-15,Performing clinical drug trials in children with a rare disease,"  Over the past 50 years, the advancements in medical and health research have
radically changed the epidemiology of health conditions in neonates, children,
and adolescents; and clinical research has on the whole, moved forward.
However, large sections of the pediatric community remain vulnerable and
underserved, by clinical research. One reason for this is the fact that most
pediatric diseases are also rare diseases (i.e., they fit the EU definition of
a rare condition, by affecting no more than 5 in 10,000 individuals), and
indeed the majority of conditions under this umbrella heading are in fact much
rarer, affecting fewer than 1 in 100,000. Rare pediatric diseases incur
particular challenges, both in terms of actually conducting clinical trials but
also planning trials (and indeed, stimulating the preclinical research and
knowledge generation necessary to embark on clinical trials in the first
place). The pediatric regulation and orphan regulation (covering rare diseases)
were introduced to address the complexities in research and development of
medicines specifically for children and for people living with a rare disease,
respectively. The regulations have been reasonably effective, particularly in
areas where adult and pediatric diseases overlap, driving the development of
more pediatric medicines; however, challenges still remain, often exacerbated
by the rarity of the diseases. These include issues around trial planning, the
need for more innovative methodologies in smaller populations, significant
delays in trial start up and recruitment, recruitment issues (due to small
populations and the nature of the conditions), lack of endpoints, and scarce
data. This chapter will discuss some of the major challenges in delivering
trials in pediatric rare diseases while also assessing current and future
solutions to address these.

lack of broadly applicable solutions. Here, we propose that the workflow used

show that GitHub, a platform widely used for collaborative software projects,
can be effectively adapted to organize and document all aspects of a research
project's lifecycle in a molecular biology laboratory. We outline a three-step
approach for incorporating the GitHub ecosystem into laboratory research
workflows: 1. designing and organizing experiments using issues and project
boards, 2. documenting experiments and data analyses with a version control
system, and 3. ensuring reproducible software environments for data analyses
and writing tasks with containerized packages. The versatility, scalability,
and affordability of this approach make it suitable for various scenarios,
ranging from small research groups to large, cross-institutional
collaborations. Adopting this framework from a project's outset can increase
the efficiency and fidelity of knowledge transfer within and across research

genomes, yet their role in chromatin organization remains poorly understood.
This study investigates the distribution patterns of TEs around chromatin
ligation points (LPs) identified through Micro-C experiments in human cells. We
analyzed the density of various TE families within a 100kb window centered on
LPs, focusing on major families such as Alu and LINE-1 (L1) elements. Our
findings reveal distinct, non-random distribution patterns that differ between
TE families and exhibit consistent strand-specific biases. These patterns were
reproducible across two independent datasets and showed marked differences from
random genomic distributions. Notably, we observed family-specific variations
in TE density near LPs, with some families showing depletion at LPs followed by
periodic fluctuations in density. The consistency of these patterns across TE
families and their orientation relative to chromosome arms suggest a
fundamental relationship between TEs and higher-order chromatin structure. Our
results provide new insights into the potential role of TEs in genome
organization and challenge the notion of TEs as passive genomic components.
This study lays the groundwork for future investigations into the functional
implications of TE distribution in chromatin architecture and gene regulation.

Engineering/University of Sulaimani/ Kurdistan Region-Iraqi to investigate
effects of different concentrations of IBA (0, 3000, 4000 and 5000 ppm) and
soaking in water for 24 hours on propagation black mulberry (Morus nigra L.) by
hardwood cuttings. In this research the parameters of rooting percentage, root
number, root length, sprout bud number, shoot length and shoot diameter were
measured. Effect of individual factors showed that the highest rooting
percentage (15%) was achieved in cuttings soaked in water for 24 hours, as well
as improving other traits. Also, the best (23.33%) rooting was found in
cuttings dipped in 4000 ppm IBA. Interaction effects of the two factors showed
that cuttings treated with 4000 ppm IBA and soaked in water for 24 hours gave
the highest (40%) rooting, and the highest other root and shoot traits were

  LLM","  The establishment of bioRxiv facilitated the rapid adoption of preprints in
the life sciences, accelerating the dissemination of new research findings.
However, the sheer volume of preprints published daily can be overwhelming,
making it challenging for researchers to stay updated on the latest
developments. Here, I introduce biorecap, an R package that retrieves and
summarizes bioRxiv preprints using a large language model (LLM) running locally
on nearly any commodity laptop. biorecap leverages the ollamar package to
interface with the Ollama server and API endpoints, allowing users to prompt
any local LLM available through Ollama. The package follows tidyverse
conventions, enabling users to pipe the output of one function as input to
another. Additionally, biorecap provides a single wrapper function that
generates a timestamped CSV file and HTML report containing short summaries of
recent preprints published in user-configurable subject areas. By combining the
strengths of LLMs with the flexibility and security of local execution,
biorecap represents an advancement in the tools available for managing the
information overload in modern scientific research. The biorecap R package is
available on GitHub at https://github.com/stephenturner/biorecap under an

to policies that estimate many models involving permutations of analytic
choices (i.e., a ""multiverse"" approach). Specifically, we evaluate the possible
biases and pitfalls of interpretation of a multiverse approach to the context
of government responses to epidemics using the example of COVID-19 and a
recently published peer-reviewed paper by Bendavid and Patel (2024) along with
the subsequent commentary that the two authors published discussing and
interpreting the implications of their work. While we identify multiple
potential errors and sources of biases in how the specific analyses were
undertaken that are also relevant for other studies employing similar
approaches, our most important finding involves constructing a counterexample
showing that causal model specification-agnostic multiverse analyses can be
incorrectly used to suggest that no consistent effect can be discovered in data
especially in cases where most specifications estimated with the data are far
from causally valid. Finally, we suggest an alternative approach involving
hypothesis-drive specifications that explicitly account for infectiousness
across jurisdictions in the analysis as well as the interconnected ways that
policies and behavioral responses may evolve within and across these
jurisdictions.

influenced by both the concentrations of IBA and the selection of rooting
media. However, the control group (without IBA) notably enhanced rooting when
compared to the various IBA concentrations. Cuttings in the control group
(without IBA) and those planted in river sand exhibited notably high
percentages of successful rooting, underscoring the importance of the selected
planting medium. Experiment 2. Bench grafting of loquat: The success of
grafting loquat cutting stocks varied based on grafting dates, types of
cuttings, and concentrations of IBA. However, IBA at different concentrations
did not have a significant impact. Notably, certain interactions such as
grafting on February 20 with loquat stock cuttings, yielded higher percentages
of successful graft bud sprouting. Experiment 3. Performance of grafting
loquats onto different rootstocks: Grafting success was notably influenced by
the selection of rootstock, with loquat rootstock demonstrating superior
performance compared to quince. The highest significant levels of successful
grafting were attained on February 20, underscoring the crucial role of
grafting dates. Experiment 4. Impact of tree stock types on grafting success:
Grafting success percentage was higher in loquat tree stock when compared to
quince. The consistency of grafting success percentages across three dates

of the most important challenges in the 21st century. Current practices often
lead to the overuse of agronomic inputs, such as synthetic fertilizers and
water, resulting in environmental contamination and diminishing returns on crop
productivity. The complexity of agricultural systems, involving
plant-environment interactions and human management, presents significant
scientific and technical challenges for developing sustainable practices.
Addressing these challenges necessitates transdisciplinary research, involving
intense collaboration among fields such as plant science, engineering, computer
science, and social sciences. Here, we present five case studies from two
research centers demonstrating successful transdisciplinary approaches toward
more sustainable water and fertilizer use. These case studies span multiple
scales. Starting from whole-plant signaling, we explore how reporter plants can
transform our understanding of plant communication and enable efficient
application of water and fertilizers. We then show how new fertilizer
technologies could increase the availability of phosphorus in the soil. To
accelerate advancements in breeding new cultivars, we discuss robotic
technologies for high-throughput plant screening in different environments at a
population scale. At the ecosystem scale, we investigate phosphorus recovery
from aquatic systems and methods to minimize phosphorus leaching. Finally, as
agricultural outputs affect all people, we show how to integrate stakeholder
perspectives and needs into the research. With these case studies, we hope to
encourage the scientific community to adopt transdisciplinary research and
promote cross-training among biologists, engineers, and social scientists to

patient data privacy has become increasingly complex, with significant
implications for global health equity and patient trust. This paper introduces
a novel ""privacy gradient"" approach to health data governance, offering a more
nuanced and adaptive framework than traditional binary privacy models. Our
multidimensional concept considers factors such as data sensitivity,
stakeholder relationships, purpose of use, and temporal aspects, allowing for
context-sensitive privacy protections. Through policy analyses, ethical
considerations, and case studies spanning adolescent health, integrated care,
and genomic research, we demonstrate how this approach can address critical
privacy challenges in diverse healthcare settings worldwide. The privacy
gradient model has the potential to enhance patient engagement, improve care
coordination, and accelerate medical research while safeguarding individual
privacy rights. We provide policy recommendations for implementing this

biodiversity in the region and the low density of existing organisms. The river
banks are characterized by their dryness at low tide due to the high
temperature, so they are not suitable for the life of many organisms except the
eurythermal and euryhaline organisms.
  Samples of crabs were collected monthly from September 2023 to June 2024 by
using a quadrate with a 1 m length end drilled to a depth of 15 cm, the air
temperature at the time of sample collection ranged from 8 to 38{\deg}C, While
the BOD ranged between 3.5 to 7.3 mg/L, As for TOC, it ranged from 0.25 to
0.54. The highest density recorded for the species Nasima dotilliformis was in
December and reached 6ind/m2 , as the highest density of the species
Leptochryseus kuwaitensis was 4ind/m2 in February, and the highest density of
the species Ilyoplax stevensi was in December and January, reaching 4ind/m2.
The species N. dotilloformis was characterized by its appearance throughout the

  calculation, conversions, and common confusions","  The sugar concentration of floral nectar is a key metric for describing
nectar composition and a major factor influencing pollinator visitation to
flowers. Across pollination biology research there are multiple approaches in
use for describing nectar sugar concentration. With these different approaches
there are several potential sources of confusion which, if not accounted for,
can lead to errors. Further potential for error arises if researchers wish to
make comparisons between the energetic content of nectars containing different
ratios of sucrose, fructose and glucose. Regardless of whether concentration is
measured per mole or per unit mass, the energetic content differs between the
hexose sugars (glucose and fructose) and sucrose. Appropriate conversion is
needed for direct comparison. Here we address these two issues with the
following aims. We consolidate the literature on this topic with examples of
the different methods for reporting nectar sugar concentrations, provide
insight into potential sources of error, and derive equations for converting
between the different ways of expressing sugar concentration for the three
primary nectar sugars: sucrose, glucose and fructose. Second, we discuss the
relative energetic content of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, and rationalise
adjustment of ""energetic value"" rather than reporting concentration directly.
In this way, we hope to harmonise ongoing work in pollination ecology.

  Revisited","  Life is a planetary feature that depends on its environment, but it has also
strongly shaped the physical conditions on Earth, having created conditions
highly suitable for a productive biosphere. Clearly, the second law of
thermodynamics must apply to these dynamics as well, but how? What insights can
we gain by placing life and its effects on planetary functioning in the context
of the second law? In Kleidon (2010), I described a thermodynamic Earth system
perspective by placing the functioning of the Earth system in terms of the
second law. The Earth system is represented by a planetary hierarchy of energy
transformations that are driven predominantly by incoming solar radiation,
these transformations are constrained by the second law, but they are also
modified by the feedbacks from various dissipative activities. It was then
hypothesised that life evolves its dissipative activity to the limits imposed
by this hierarchy and evolves feedbacks aimed at pushing these limits to higher
levels of dissipative activity. Here I provide an update of this perspective. I
first review applications to climate and global climate change to demonstrate
its success in predicting magnitudes of physical processes, particularly
regarding temperatures, heat redistribution and hydrological cycling. I then
focus on the limits to dissipative activity of the biosphere. It would seem
that the limitations by thermodynamics act indirectly by imposing limitations
associated with transport and material exchange. I substantiate this
interpretation and discuss the broader implications for habitability, the
emergence and evolution of life, and the contemporary biosphere.

2410.20506,2024-10-29,A twenty-first century statistical physics of life,"  The molecular biology revolution of the last seventy five years has
transformed our view of living systems. Scientific explanations of biological
phenomena are now synonymous with the identification of the genes, proteins,
and signaling molecules involved. The hegemony of the molecular paradigm has
only become more pronounced as new technologies allow us to make measurements
at scale. Combining this wealth of data with new ``artificial intelligence''
techniques is viewed as the future of biology. Here, we challenge this emerging
``common sense'', laying out a roadmap for developing a theoretical
understanding of life. We argue that a twenty-first century theoretical biology
must be founded on a new type of statistical physics suited to the living
world. Rather than merely constructing statistical models, a statistical theory
requires developing ``quantitative abstractions'' for understanding the
gene-organism-environment triad. This necessitates overcoming four major
challenges that distinguish living matter: (1) living systems are composed of a
large number of heterogeneous parts rather than a large number of identical
objects; (2) living systems control and manipulate the physical world in a
manner that is extremely different from the ways considered in traditional
statistical physics; (3) living systems necessarily operate out of equilibrium;
(4) living systems are evolved objects with a function, resulting in new types
of constraints that must be imposed on probabilistic ensembles. We conclude by
discussing a few key themes that we view as promising directions for developing
a statistical physics of life: typicality, localized biological control, a
linear response of complex systems with non-reciprocal interactions, biological
resource allocation, and learning and adaptation in overparameterized systems.

  the snail Tegula nigerrima","  One of goals in soft robotics is to achive spontaneous behavior like real
organisms. To gain a clue to achieve this, we examined the long (16-hour)
spontaneous exploratory locomotion of snails. The active forager snail, Tegula
nigerrima, from an intertidal rocky shore was selected to test the general
hypothesis that nervous systems are inherently near a critical state, which is
self-organized to drive spontaneous animal behavior. This hypothesis, known as
the critical brain hypothesis, was originally proposed for vertebrate species,
but it might be applicable to other invertebrate species as well. We first
investigated the power spectra of the speed of locomotion of the snails
($N=39$). The spectra showed $1/{f^\alpha}$ fluctuation, which is one of the
signatures of self-organized criticality. The $\alpha$ was estimated to be
about 0.9. We further examined whether the spatial and temporal quantities show
multiple power-laws and scaling relations, which are rigorous criteria of
criticality. Although the satisfaction of these criteria is limited to a
truncated region and provides limited evidence to demonstrate the aspect of
self-organization, the multiple power-laws and the scaling relations were
overall satisfied. Therefore, these results additionally support the generality
of the critical brain hypothesis.

explore the behavior of nanorobots in a three-dimensional space with cancer
cells and biological barriers. The proposed method uses Q-learning to refine
movement strategies based on real-time biomarker concentration data, enabling
nanorobots to autonomously navigate to cancerous tissues for targeted drug
delivery. This research lays the groundwork for future laboratory experiments
and clinical applications, with implications for personalized medicine and less
invasive cancer treatments. The integration of intelligent nanorobots could
revolutionize therapeutic strategies, reducing side effects and enhancing
treatment effectiveness for cancer patients. Further research will investigate
the practical deployment of these technologies in medical settings, aiming to

2411.03621,2024-11-07,"Beyond networks, towards adaptive systems","  Despite their widespread utility across domains, basic network models face
fundamental limitations when applied to complex biological systems,
particularly in neuroscience. This paper critically examines these limitations
and explores potential extensions and alternative frameworks better suited to
capture the adaptive nature of biological systems. Key challenges include: the
need to account for time-varying connections and adaptive topologies; the
difficulty in representing multilevel systems with cross-level interactions;
the inadequacy of fixed state spaces for systems that continuously expand their
range of possible states; and the challenge of modeling deep history dependence
and open-world interactions. While some limitations can be partially addressed
through extensions like multilayer networks and time-varying connections, I
argue that biological systems exhibit radical context dependence and
open-endedness that resist conventional mathematical formalization. Using
examples primarily from neuroscience, I demonstrate how even sophisticated
approaches incorporating dynamics and context sensitivity fall short in fully
capturing biological complexity. Moving forward requires developing frameworks
that explicitly account for adaptive reconfiguration, embrace open-ended state
spaces, and draw inspiration from concepts like Kauffman's ""adjacent possible.""
The path ahead demands mathematical and computational approaches that are

2411.08082,2024-11-14,Explainable Deep Learning Framework for SERS Bio-quantification,"  Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a potential fast and
inexpensive method of analyte quantification, which can be combined with deep
learning to discover biomarker-disease relationships. This study aims to
address present challenges of SERS through a novel SERS bio-quantification
framework, including spectral processing, analyte quantification, and model
explainability. To this end,serotonin quantification in urine media was
assessed as a model task with 682 SERS spectra measured in a micromolar range
using cucurbit[8]uril chemical spacers. A denoising autoencoder was utilized
for spectral enhancement, and convolutional neural networks (CNN) and vision
transformers were utilized for biomarker quantification. Lastly, a novel
context representative interpretable model explanations (CRIME) method was
developed to suit the current needs of SERS mixture analysis explainability.
Serotonin quantification was most efficient in denoised spectra analysed using
a convolutional neural network with a three-parameter logistic output layer
(mean absolute error = 0.15 {\mu}M, mean percentage error = 4.67%).
Subsequently, the CRIME method revealed the CNN model to present six prediction
contexts, of which three were associated with serotonin. The proposed framework
could unlock a novel, untargeted hypothesis generating method of biomarker
discovery considering the rapid and inexpensive nature of SERS measurements,
and the potential to identify biomarkers from CRIME contexts.

2411.10511,2025-05-06,How quantum computing can enhance biomarker discovery,"  Biomarkers play a central role in medicine's gradual progress towards
proactive, personalized precision diagnostics and interventions. However,
finding biomarkers that provide very early indicators of a change in health
status, for example for multi-factorial diseases, has been challenging.
Discovery of such biomarkers stands to benefit significantly from advanced
information processing and means to detect complex correlations, which quantum
computing offers. In this perspective paper, quantum algorithms, particularly
in machine learning, are mapped to key applications in biomarker discovery. The
opportunities and challenges associated with the algorithms and applications
are discussed. The analysis is structured according to different data types -
multi-dimensional, time series, and erroneous data - and covers key data
modalities in healthcare - electronic health records (EHRs), omics, and medical
images. An outlook is provided concerning open research challenges.

2411.12779,2024-11-21,Chikungunya: The Silent Threat in the Shadows,"  Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is one of the most relevant arboviruses affecting
public health today. It belongs to the Togaviridae family and alphavirus genus,
causing an arthritogenic disease known as Chikungunya fever (CHIKF). This
multifaceted disease is distinguished from other arbovirus infections by
intense arthralgia, which can persist for months or even years in some
individuals. The virus has re-emerged as a global health threat in recent
decades, originating in Africa and spreading across Asia and America, leading
to widespread outbreaks affecting millions. Despite more than 50 years of
research on CHIKV pathogenesis, no drugs or vaccines are available. Current
management focuses on supportive care to alleviate symptoms and improve
patient's quality of life. The ongoing threat posed by CHIKV highlights the
need to understand its pathogenesis better. This review provides a
comprehensive overview of CHIKV, focusing on host factors, vector-related
factors, and complex viral genetic interactions. By exploring these intricate
connections, we aim to offer insights that may lead to more effective
strategies for preventing and managing this re-emerging global health threat.

2411.17750,2024-11-28,Determinants of Longevity amongst SSNIT Pensioners in Ghana,"  This paper statistically analysed pensioner longevity in Ghana. It
fundamentally sought to ascertain the significant determinants of longevity
amongst Ghanaian pensioners, specifically, SSNIT pensioners by estimating the
mortality rate of SSNIT pensioners, determining the factors that significantly
affect the longevity of the average SSNIT pensioner and constructing a
predictive model for predicting the longevity of SSNIT pensioners in Ghana.
Secondary data was obtained from the leading pension provider in Ghana, SSNIT.
The results of the study revealed that the total number of male deaths was
significantly greater, about four times more, than the total number of female
deaths. There was sufficient evidence that there exists a lower rate of death
among female pensioners as compared to male pensioners. Furthermore, a
significant number of the SSNIT pensioners used in the analysis survived less
than 8 years after retirement before their death and the average basic salary
of the pensioners who lived less than 8 years after retirement was GH 7741.827
cedis and served for 35.65 years on average. On the contrary, it was observed
that pensioners who lived more than 8 years after retirement had an average
basic salary of GH 5544.20 cedis and served for 31.49 years on average. In
conclusion, predictors such as basic salary, the number of years of service in
the workforce, the age of the pensioner before death and the gender of the
pensioner were statistically significant in predicting the number of years a
SSNIT pensioner survived after retirement before death that is, whether a
particular SSNIT pensioner survived less than 8 years or 8 years and above
after retirement. The authors recommend to employees that, their health should
be of great priority as every increase in the service year increases the
likelihood of a SSNIT pensioner surviving less than 8 years after retirement by
22.36%.

2411.19416,2024-12-02,"A method for finding distribution of metabolic energy between organismal
  functions: application to birds' energy expenditures to counteract gravity
  and to support steady and short flights","  Production of energy (metabolism) and its distribution is vital for living
organisms, both at individual level - between different functions of an
organism, as well as between species of communities at different organizational
levels, including food chains. Here, a new general method for finding
distribution of metabolic energy between different organismal functions is
proposed. The method is based on earlier discoveries (in two independent
studies, for multicellular and unicellular organisms) that metabolic allometric
scaling is the result of natural selection guided by optimization of
distribution of common resources between the species of a food chain. This
distribution is established in such a way that it secures amount of resources
for each species to reproduce in sufficient quantities (sufficient for
preservation of a food chain), while not allowing some species acquiring too
many resources to jeopardize existence of other species they prey on or share
common resources with. The introduced method was applied to birds, including
both steady and short flights modes. Birds' metabolism has specifics, because
besides other functions, it has to compensate force of gravity during the
flight. However, this parameter is difficult to find, while such data is
important for ecological studies at population and individual levels. We
discovered increase of fraction of metabolic power required to compensate force
of gravity with mass increase, which is a principal factor, restricting maximum
possible mass of flying animals. The obtained results show efficiency of a
proposed method for detailed studies of animals' metabolism, physiology, and of
population ecology.

2412.07504,2024-12-11,Deterministic Storage of Quantum Information in the Genetic Code,"  DNA has been proposed as a chemical platform for computing and data storage,
paving the way for building DNA-based computers. Recently, DNA has been
hypothesized as an ideal quantum computer with the base pairs working as
Josephson junctions. There are still major challenges to be overcome in these
directions, but they do not prevent deviceful perspectives of the main problem.
The present paper explores DNA base pairs as elementary units for a scalable
nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer (NMRQC). First, it presents an
overview of the proton transfer (PT) mechanism during the prototropic
tautomerism in the base pairs, scoring the current stage. Second, as a
proof-of-principle, the paper examines these molecular structures as quantum
processing units (QPUs) of a biochemical quantum device. For the model proposed
here, it is theoretically demonstrated that the nuclear spins involved in the
PT of base pairs can be deterministically prepared in a superposition of
triplet states. Under appropriate conditions, the proton dynamics provides the
minimal two-qubit entanglement required for quantum computing. The dynamics
between the canonical and tautomeric quantum states (CQS and TQS, respectively)
is determined from a thermally dependent Watson-Crick quantum superposition
(WCQS); i.e., |WCQS> = a(T)|CQS> + b(T)|TQS> with |a(T)|^2 + |b(T)|^2 = 1. If
the DNA structure is sufficiently protected to avoid environment-induced
decoherence of the confined-proton quantum states, quantum information can be
successfully encoded in several base pairs along the coiled double strand. As a
potential applicability, a crystalline DNA device could be employed for quantum
computing and cryptography controlled by a sequence of Ramsey pulses. Finally,
this study critically evaluates these possibilities toward a proof-of-concept
of a DNA-based quantum computer.

  synergistic effects of biogenic Cu/Ni/Co oxide nanoparticles in conjunction
  with rice straw and pressmud based vermicompost","  This study is a continuation of previous work, which highlights the nutrient
enhancement by using rice straw (RS) and pressmud (PM) on vermicomposting.
Herein, we demonstrate the significant impact of Moringa oleifera derived
Cu/Ni/Co oxide nanoparticles (TmONs) in conjunction with these vermicompost on
the growth performance of Abelmoschus esculentus. Vermicompost produced under
various combinations (T0, cow dung (CD) only; T1, 1CD:1RS; T2, 1CD:1PM, and T3,
1CD:1RS:1PM) were further enriched by blending with biogenic nanoparticles.
This strategic combination enhances the nutritional composition of the
vermicompost, contributing to its overall effectiveness in promoting plant
growth and health. Various analytical techniques, including FTIR, XRD, XPS,
FESEM-EDX, TEM, and ICP-OES, were employed for comprehensive characterization.
The synthesized TmONs with sizes ranging from 13 to 54 nm exhibited distinct
CuO, NiO, and CoO phases. The vermicompost blended TmONs demonstrated
significant improvements (P < 0.05) in seed germination (167%), coefficient
velocity (67%), and vigour index (95%), while reducing the mean germination
time by 41% for A. esculentus compared to the control group. The plant culture
group nT3 (T3 + TmONs) showed the best growth performance. Furthermore, trace
element concentrations in both soil and plant leaves were found to be below the
maximum permissible limits set by WHO (1996). This investigation extends the
understanding of the role played by these nanoparticles in fostering optimal
conditions for plant growth and development as these micronutrients are
essential components for several plant enzymes.

2412.14338,2024-12-20,GREGoR: Accelerating Genomics for Rare Diseases,"  Rare diseases are collectively common, affecting approximately one in twenty
individuals worldwide. In recent years, rapid progress has been made in rare
disease diagnostics due to advances in DNA sequencing, development of new
computational and experimental approaches to prioritize genes and genetic
variants, and increased global exchange of clinical and genetic data. However,
more than half of individuals suspected to have a rare disease lack a genetic
diagnosis. The Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare Diseases
(GREGoR) Consortium was initiated to study thousands of challenging rare
disease cases and families and apply, standardize, and evaluate emerging
genomics technologies and analytics to accelerate their adoption in clinical
practice. Further, all data generated, currently representing ~7500 individuals
from ~3000 families, is rapidly made available to researchers worldwide via the
Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL)
to catalyze global efforts to develop approaches for genetic diagnoses in rare
diseases (https://gregorconsortium.org/data). The majority of these families
have undergone prior clinical genetic testing but remained unsolved, with most
being exome-negative. Here, we describe the collaborative research framework,
datasets, and discoveries comprising GREGoR that will provide foundational
resources and substrates for the future of rare disease genomics.

2412.16705,2024-12-24,"Exploring the Multifractal Behavior of the Human Genome T2T-CHM13v2.0:
  Graphical Representations and Cytogenetics","  In this work, we applied the Chaos Game Representation (CGR) to the complete
human genomic sequence T2T-CHM13v2.0, analyzing the entire chromosome assembly
and each chromosome separately, including mitochondrial DNA. Multifractal
spectra were determined using two types of box-counting coverage, revealing
slight variations across most chromosomes. While the geometric support remained
consistent, distinct distributions were observed for each chromosome.
Chromosomes 9 and Y exhibited the greatest differences in singularity (H\""older
exponent), with minor variations in their fractal support. The CGR
distributions generally demonstrated an approximate separation between coding
and non-coding sections, as well as CpG or GpC islands. A base-by-base analysis
of the fractal support of the CGR uncovered characteristic structural bands in
chromosome sequences, which align with patterns identified in cytogenetic
studies. Using the complete assembly as a reference, we compared two
alternative representations: the Binary Genomic Representation (RGB) and the
Markov Chain (MC) representation. Both methods tended toward the same fractal
support but displayed differing distributions based on the assigned length
parameter. Multifractal analysis highlighted quantitative differences between
these representations: RGB aligned more closely with high-frequency components,
while MC showed better correspondence with low frequencies. The optimal fit was
achieved using MC for twelve-base chains, yielding an average percentage error
of 2% relative to the full genomic assembly.

2412.17923,2024-12-25,A New Parameterization of Photoinhibition For Phytoplankton,"  Mathematical models of photosynthesis-irradiance relationships in
phytoplankton are used to compute integrated water-column photosynthetic rates
and predict primary production in ecosystem models. Models typically ignore an
important phenomenon observed in most experiments: photosynthetic rate is an
approximately constant maximum value over a range of irradiances until
photoinhibition leads to decreasing photosynthetic rate. Here we develop a new
model of photoinhibition that captures this plateau. We test six new models of
photoinhibition and ten more photoinhibition models from the literature against
a database of 1808 photosynthesis-irradiance curves exhibiting photoinhibition.
In the best model, photoinhibition is phenomenologically described by
multiplication by a saturating function of the reciprocal of irradiance,
simplifies to the widely-used Jassby & Platt photosynthesis-irradiance curve in
the absence of photoinhibition, and only requires one new parameter. This
photoinhibition parameter identifies the onset of photoinhibition and is the
rate of decrease in photosynthetic rate at that irradiance. The parameters
common to both of these models have a consistent interpretation, but our
analysis of 3,615 experiments and 10,000 simulated datasets revealed
significant discrepancies in parameter interpretation across other widely-used
photoinhibition models. Deviations in parameter estimates across models of up
to 40% were observed underscoring the need for consistent modeling approaches
and supporting the application of our new photoinhibition model.

2412.20616,2024-12-31,Hilbert Curve Based Molecular Sequence Analysis,"  Accurate molecular sequence analysis is a key task in the field of
bioinformatics. To apply molecular sequence classification algorithms, we first
need to generate the appropriate representations of the sequences. Traditional
numeric sequence representation techniques are mostly based on sequence
alignment that faces limitations in the form of lack of accuracy. Although
several alignment-free techniques have also been introduced, their tabular data
form results in low performance when used with Deep Learning (DL) models
compared to the competitive performance observed in the case of image-based
data. To find a solution to this problem and to make Deep Learning (DL) models
function to their maximum potential while capturing the important spatial
information in the sequence data, we propose a universal Hibert curve-based
Chaos Game Representation (CGR) method. This method is a transformative
function that involves a novel Alphabetic index mapping technique used in
constructing Hilbert curve-based image representation from molecular sequences.
Our method can be globally applied to any type of molecular sequence data. The
Hilbert curve-based image representations can be used as input to sophisticated
vision DL models for sequence classification. The proposed method shows
promising results as it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by
achieving a high accuracy of $94.5$\% and an F1 score of $93.9\%$ when tested
with the CNN model on the lung cancer dataset. This approach opens up a new
horizon for exploring molecular sequence analysis using image classification
methods.

  metabolic syndrome among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in
  Australia","  Although previous observational studies have shown associations between serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration and metabolic syndrome, this
association has not yet been investigated among Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander peoples. We aimed to investigate the association between serum 25(OH)D
concentration and metabolic syndrome and its risk factors in this population
group. We used cross-sectional data from the 2012-2013 Australian Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey. Metabolic syndrome is defined as
having 3 or more risk factors: elevated waist circumference, elevated
triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, elevated blood
pressure, or elevated fasting blood glucose. We used binomial logistic
regression to test associations between serum 25(OH)D concentration and
metabolic syndrome, and multiple linear regression to test associations between
serum 25(OH)D concentration and each risk factor. We included the following
covariates: age, sex, smoking status, education level, socio-economic status,
remoteness of location, season, and body mass index (BMI). After adjusting for
covariates, we found that each 10 nmol/L increase in serum 25(OH)D
concentration was statistically significantly associated with a 16% lower risk
of metabolic syndrome (odds ratio: 0.84, 95% confidence interval: 0.76, 0.92)
and a 2.1 cm (95% confidence interval: 1.65, 2.57) lower waist circumference
(BMI was not included in the model for waist circumference). We found small
inverse associations between serum 25(OH)D concentration and all other risk
factors except systolic blood pressure. Given that higher serum 25(OH)D
concentration may confer metabolic health benefits, promoting vitamin D
sufficiency may be beneficial for this population.

2501.01454,2025-04-28,A Fourfold Pathogen Reference Ontology Suite,"  Infectious diseases remain a critical global health challenge, and the
integration of standardized ontologies plays a vital role in managing related
data. The Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) and its extensions, such as the
Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO), are essential for organizing
and disseminating information related to infectious diseases. The COVID-19
pandemic highlighted the need for updating IDO and its virus-specific
extensions. There is an additional need to update IDO extensions specific to
bacteria, fungus, and parasite infectious diseases. We adopt the ""hub and
spoke"" methodology to generate pathogen-specific extensions of IDO: Virus
Infectious Disease Ontology (VIDO), Bacteria Infectious Disease Ontology
(BIDO), Mycosis Infectious Disease Ontology (MIDO), and Parasite Infectious
Disease Ontology (PIDO). The creation of pathogen-specific reference ontologies
advances modularization and reusability of infectious disease data within the

  tracking control of brain network dynamics","  Network control theory (NCT) has recently been utilized in neuroscience to
facilitate our understanding of brain stimulation effects. A particularly
useful branch of NCT is optimal control, which focuses on applying theoretical
and computational principles of control theory to design optimal strategies to
achieve specific goals in neural processes. However, most existing research
focuses on optimally controlling brain network dynamics from the original state
to a target state at a specific time point. In this paper, we present the first
investigation of introducing optimal stochastic tracking control strategy to
synchronize the dynamics of the brain network to a target dynamics rather than
to a target state at a specific time point. We utilized fMRI data from healthy
groups, and cases of stroke and post-stroke aphasia. For all participants, we
utilized a gradient descent optimization method to estimate the parameters for
the brain network dynamic system. We then utilized optimal stochastic tracking
control techniques to drive original unhealthy dynamics by controlling a
certain number of nodes to synchronize with target healthy dynamics. Results
show that the energy associated with optimal stochastic tracking control is
negatively correlated with the intrinsic average controllability of the brain
network system, while the energy of the optimal state approaching control is
significantly related to the target state value. For a 100-dimensional brain
network system, controlling the five nodes with the lowest tracking energy can
achieve relatively acceptable dynamics control effects. Our results suggest
that stochastic tracking control is more aligned with the objective of brain
stimulation interventions, and is closely related to the intrinsic
characteristics of the brain network system, potentially representing a new
direction for future brain network optimal control research.

2501.09473,2025-01-17,An Asymptotic Analysis of Bivalent Monoclonal Antibody-Antigen Binding,"  Ligand-receptor interactions are fundamental to many biological processes.
For example in antibody-based immunotherapies, the dynamics of an antibody
binding with its target antigen directly influence the potency and efficacy of
monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies. In this paper, we present an asymptotic
analysis of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of bivalent
antibody-antigen binding in the context of mAb cancer therapies, highlighting
the added complexity associated with bivalency of the antibody. To understand
what drives the complex temporal dynamics of bivalent antibody-antigen binding,
we construct asymptotic approximations to the model's solutions at different
timescales and antibody concentrations that are in good agreement with
numerical simulations of the full model. We show how the dynamics differ
between two scenarios; a region where unbound antigens are abundant, and one
where the number of unbound antigens is small such that the dominant balance
within the model equations changes. Of particular importance to the potency and
efficacy of mAb treatments are the values of quantities such as antigen
occupancy and bound antibody number. We use the results of our asymptotic
analysis to approximate the long-time values of these quantities that could be
combined with experimental data to facilitate parameter estimation.

formaldehyde, respectively; and groups 4-7 were exposed to 1000, 2000, 4000,
and 8000ppm of extracts, respectively, for 96 hours. Results: The
phytochemistry revealed high levels of flavonoids and saponins and moderate
levels of tannins and phenols. The heavy metal analysis revealed non-tolerable
levels of cadmium, copper, and lead, while zinc was within the tolerable limit.
The negative control recorded 10% mortality, 1000 and 2000 ppm (20% each),
4000ppm (70%), and 8000 ppm (100%). Conclusion: These results inferred safe

significant progress has been made in areas such as gene regulation editing and
protein structure prediction. However, given the vast amount of genomic data,
the segments that can be fully annotated and understood remain relatively
limited. If we consider the genome as a book, constructing its equivalents of
words, sentences, and paragraphs has been a long-standing and popular research
direction. Recently, studies on transfer learning in large language models have
provided a novel approach to this challenge.Multilingual transfer ability,
which assesses how well models fine-tuned on a source language can be applied
to other languages, has been extensively studied in multilingual pre-trained
models. Similarly, the transfer of natural language capabilities to ""DNA
language"" has also been validated. Building upon these findings, we first
trained a foundational model capable of transferring linguistic capabilities
from English to DNA sequences. Using this model, we constructed a vocabulary of
DNA words and mapped DNA words to their English equivalents.Subsequently, we
fine-tuned this model using English datasets for paragraphing and sentence
segmentation to develop models capable of segmenting DNA sequences into
sentences and paragraphs. Leveraging these models, we processed the GRCh38.p14
human genome by segmenting, tokenizing, and organizing it into a ""book""
comprised of genomic ""words,"" ""sentences,"" and ""paragraphs."" Additionally,
based on the DNA-to-English vocabulary mapping, we created an ""English version""
of the genomic book. This study offers a novel perspective for understanding
the genome and provides exciting possibilities for developing innovative tools

traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for treating various ailments, including
diarrhea, abdominal pain, inflammation, asthma, and diabetes. While previous
research has primarily focused on its essential oils, studies on its
protein-derived bioactive peptides remain limited. In this study, we employed
an innovative extraction method to isolate peptides from cumin seeds for the
first time and screened their biological activities, revealing significant
antimicrobial, antioxidant, and hypoglycemic properties. Guided by bioactivity,
we utilized advanced separation and structural identification techniques,
including Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass
Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS), to systematically purify and characterize
cumin-derived peptides. A total of 479 unique peptide sequences were identified
using Mascot software and the SwissProt/UniProt_Bos databases. Among these, 15
highly bioactive peptides were selected for further analysis based on
bioactivity and toxicity predictions using PeptideRanker and ToxinPred.
Structural characterization revealed key features, such as {\alpha}-helices and
\b{eta}-sheets, associated with their multifunctional activities. This study
provides the first comprehensive analysis of bioactive peptides from Cuminum

2502.01716,2025-02-05,Design of Engineered Living Materials for Martian Construction,"  As the next step in extraterrestrial exploration, many engineers and
scientists around the country revealed their intense interest to enable
multiplanetary human life, including colonizing Mars. This study proposes that
architecture on Mars can be realized by a synthetic lichen system, composed of
diazotrophic cyanobacteria and filamentous fungi, which produce abundant
biominerals and biopolymers to bond Martian regolith into consolidated building
blocks. These self-growing building blocks can be assembled into a wide range
of structures. Diazotrophic cyanobacteria will 1) fix carbon dioxide and
dinitrogen from the atmosphere and convert them into oxygen and organic carbon
and nitrogen sources to support filamentous fungi; and 2) give rise to high
concentrations of carbonate ions because of photosynthetic activities.
Filamentous fungi will 1) bind metal ions onto fungal cell walls and serve as
nucleation sites to promote biomineral precipitates; and 2) assist the survival
and growth of cyanobacteria by providing them water, minerals, additional
carbon dioxide, and protection. This report presents the major progress of the
project. It has been tested and confirmed that such co-culture systems can be
created, and they grow very well solely on Martian regolith simulants, air,
light, and an inorganic liquid medium without any additional carbon or nitrogen
sources. The cyanobacterial and fungal growth in such co-culture systems is
significantly better than their axenic growth due to mutual interactions. The
amounts and morphologies of the precipitated crystals vary remarkably depending
on the cultivation condition.

  Mellitus Management","  Diabetes mellitus is a global health crisis characterized by poor blood sugar
regulation, impacting millions of people worldwide and leading to severe
complications and mortality. Although Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) has a
lower number of cases compared to other forms of diabetes, it is often
diagnosed at a young age and requires lifelong exogenous insulin
administration. In this paper, we focus on understanding the interaction of
insulin and glucose molecules within the subcutaneous layer, which is crucial
for blood sugar control in T1DM patients. Specifically, we propose a
comprehensive model to characterize the insulin-glucose system within the
subcutaneous layer, incorporating a multicellular molecular communication
system. We then divide the T1DM system into insulin and glucose subsystems and
derive the end-to-end expression for insulin-glucose interaction in the
subcutaneous layer. We further validate the insulin-glucose interaction
analysis with an agent-based simulator. As effectively managing postprandial
glucose levels is crucial for individuals with T1DM to safeguard their overall
health and avert short-term and long-term complications, we also derive the
optimal insulin administration time based on the derived glucose response via
the Lagrange multiplier and gradient descent ascent method. This allows us to
explore the impact of different types of insulin and dietary management on
blood sugar levels. Simulation results confirm the correctness of our proposed
model and the effectiveness of our optimized effective time window for
injecting insulin in individuals with T1DM.

  Thresholds Revealed by Mathematical Modeling","  Adaptive therapy (AT) improves cancer treatment by controlling the
competition between sensitive and resistant cells through treatment holidays.
This study highlights the critical role of treatment-holiday thresholds in AT
for tumors composed of drug-sensitive and resistant cells. Using a
Lotka-Volterra model, the research compares AT with maximum tolerated dose
therapy and intermittent therapy, showing that AT's success largely depends on
the threshold at which treatment is paused and resumed, as well as on the
competition between sensitive and resistant cells. Three scenarios of
comparison between AT and other therapies are identified: uniform-decline,
conditional-improve, and uniform-improve, illustrating that optimizing the
treatment-holiday threshold is crucial for AT effectiveness. Tumor composition,
including initial tumor burden and the proportion of resistant cells,
influences outcomes. Adjusting threshold values enables AT to suppress
resistant subclones, preserving sensitive cells, ultimately improving
progression-free survival. These findings emphasize the importance of
personalized treatment strategies potentially enhancing long-term therapeutic
outcomes.

Twenty-four rats were randomly selected and divided into four groups, each
comprising six rats. Group 1 (control) rats were fed on pellet feeds and groups
2, 3, and 4 were fed on daily dosages of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g gluten extracts,
respectively. The rats' body weights and reactions were observed for 90 days

tests. Histopathological examinations of the liver and kidneys were also
performed. Results: There was no difference (P > 0.05) in body weight, blood
glucose level, or micronuclei between the control and treated rats. The
lymphocytes, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, total protein, and
calcium ions of the test rats were all significantly (P < 0.05) altered but
remained within the normal ranges. Other hematobiochemical parameters,
including packed cell volume, hemoglobin, white and red blood cells, aspartate
transaminase, albumin, sodium ions, potassium ions, chloride ions, and urea,

that mRNA translation and decay can be coupled. While being translated, a mRNA

an AI co-scientist, a multi-agent system built on Gemini 2.0. The AI
co-scientist is intended to help uncover new, original knowledge and to
formulate demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon
prior evidence and aligned to scientist-provided research objectives and
guidance. The system's design incorporates a generate, debate, and evolve
approach to hypothesis generation, inspired by the scientific method and
accelerated by scaling test-time compute. Key contributions include: (1) a
multi-agent architecture with an asynchronous task execution framework for
flexible compute scaling; (2) a tournament evolution process for self-improving
hypotheses generation. Automated evaluations show continued benefits of
test-time compute, improving hypothesis quality. While general purpose, we
focus development and validation in three biomedical areas: drug repurposing,
novel target discovery, and explaining mechanisms of bacterial evolution and
anti-microbial resistance. For drug repurposing, the system proposes candidates
with promising validation findings, including candidates for acute myeloid
leukemia that show tumor inhibition in vitro at clinically applicable
concentrations. For novel target discovery, the AI co-scientist proposed new
epigenetic targets for liver fibrosis, validated by anti-fibrotic activity and
liver cell regeneration in human hepatic organoids. Finally, the AI
co-scientist recapitulated unpublished experimental results via a parallel in
silico discovery of a novel gene transfer mechanism in bacterial evolution.
These results, detailed in separate, co-timed reports, demonstrate the
potential to augment biomedical and scientific discovery and usher an era of AI

  real world calendar app data","  Chronotypes allow for comparisons of one individual's daily rhythms to that
of others and the environment. Mismatch between an individual's chronotype and
the timing constraints of their social environment create social jet lag, which
is correlated with mental and physical health risks. The concept of chronotype
implicitly supposes that a single phase applies to an individual, whereas the
circadian rhythms of different internal systems entrain to or have their
outputs masked by different environmental inputs. If the modern environment
interferes with internal synchrony or generates different masking for different
internal system's outputs, then real world data reflecting these outputs ought
to reveal relatively low correlations, reflecting environmental interference.
At the other extreme, if there is no behavior or tissue specific interference,
then different internal system outputs should all be equally predicted from
data modalities capturing their different outputs. Here we explore multimodal
behavioral rhythm data from the Owaves calendaring app, focusing on behavioral
outputs logged as: Sleep, Exercise, Eat, Work, Love, Play, Relax, Misc. We find
that individuals show daily rhythms within each behavior type from which
chronotypes can be assigned, but that chronotypes derived from different
behaviors (or combinations of behaviors) lead to nearly independent sorting of
individual's by phase. This suggests that if real world data are used to assign
an individuals chronotype, then that chronotype may be specific to the internal
system the output of which is related to each specific data modality assessed.
Our findings suggest that researchers cannot confidently assume to account for
outputs from other internal systems in real world settings without additional
observations or controls.

2503.07837,2025-03-18,"Slowing translation to avoid ribosome population extinction and maintain
  stable allocation at slow growth rates","  To double the cellular population of ribosomes, a fraction of the active
ribosomes is allocated to synthesize ribosomal proteins. Subsequently, these
ribosomal proteins enter the ribosome self-assembly process, synthesizing new
ribosomes and forming the well-known ribosome autocatalytic subcycle.
Neglecting ribosome lifetime and the duration of the self-assembly process, the
doubling rate of all cellular biomass can be equated with the fraction of
ribosomes allocated to synthesize an essential ribosomal protein times its
synthesis rate. However, ribosomes have a finite lifetime, and the assembly
process has a finite duration. Furthermore, the number of ribosomes is known to
decrease with slow growth rates. The finite lifetime of ribosomes and the
decline in their numbers present a challenge in sustaining slow growth solely
through controlling the allocation of ribosomes to synthesize more ribosomal
proteins. When the number of ribosomes allocated per mRNA of an essential
ribosomal protein is approximately one, the resulting fluctuations in the
production rate of new ribosomes increase, causing a potential risk that the
actual production rate will fall below the ribosome death rate. Thus, in this
regime, a significant risk of extinction of the ribosome population emerges. To
mitigate this risk, we suggest that the ribosome translation speed is used as
an alternative control parameter, which facilitates the maintenance of slow
growth rates with a larger ribosome pool. We clarify the observed reduction in
translation speed at harsh environments in E. coli and C. Glutamicum, explore
other mitigation strategies, and suggest additional falsifiable predictions of
our model.

Methods: Analysis of 18144 adults with ID (10168 males and 7976 females)
identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, linked to Hospital
Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care and Outpatient data (2000-2021). We
used temporal analysis to establish directional associations among 40 long-term
conditions, stratified by sex and age groups (under 45, 45-64, 65 and over).
  Results: The high prevalence of enduring mental illness across all age groups
is an important finding unique to this population. In males, mental illness
occurred along with upper gastrointestinal conditions (specifically reflux
disorders), while in females, mental illness presented alongside reflux
disorders, chronic pain, and endocrine conditions such as thyroid problems.
Among young males with intellectual disability, the combination of cerebral
palsy with dysphagia, epilepsy, chronic constipation, and chronic pneumonia
represents a distinctive pattern. In those aged 45-64, we observed early onset
of lifestyle conditions like diabetes and hypertension, though notably these
conditions co-occurred with mental illness and anaemia at rates exceeding those
in the general population. The health conditions in those aged 65 and over
largely mirrored those seen in the general aging population.
  Conclusions: Our findings highlight the complex patterns of MLTCs in this
population, revealing sex-specific associations across age groups, and
identified temporal associations, thus providing insights into disease
progression, which can inform targeted prevention strategies and interventions
to prevent premature mortality.

parameters of marginal cells and inner cells. We find strong boundary effects
that are manifested in the distinct distributions of interior angles and edge
lengths in marginal cells. Similar to inner cells, cell division tend to occur
in marginal cells with large sizes. Our findings suggest that inner cells
should be strictly defined based on their positional relationship to the
marginal cells.

2503.18858,2025-03-25,"Dynamics of Insect Paraintelligence: How a Mindless Colony of Ants
  Meaningfully Moves a Beetle","  In this work, a new concept called Vector Dissipation of Randomness (VDR) is
developed and formalized. It describes the mechanism by which complex
multicomponent systems transition from chaos to order through the filtering of
random directions, accumulation of information in the environment, and
self-organization of agents. VDR explains how individual random strategies can
evolve into collective goaldirected behavior, leading to the emergence of an
ordered structure without centralized control. To test the proposed model, a
numerical simulation of the ""ant and beetle"" system was conducted, in which
agents (ants) randomly choose movement directions, but through feedback
mechanisms and filtering of weak strategies, they form a single coordinated
vector of the beetles movement. VDR is a universal mechanism applicable to a
wide range of self-organizing systems, including biological populations,
decentralized technological networks, sociological processes, and artificial
intelligence algorithms. For the first time, an equation of the normalized
emergence function in the processing of vector dissipation of randomness in the
Ant and Beetle system has been formulated. The concept of paraintelligence was
introduced for the first time. Insect paraintelligence is interpreted as a
rational functionality that is close to or equivalent to intelligent activity
in the absence of reflexive consciousness and selfawareness.

2503.22441,2025-03-31,Gene-environment interplay and public policies,"  We posit that gene-environment interplay (GxE) studies should be developed
both theoretically and empirically to be of relevance to policy makers. On the
theoretical front, this development is essential because the current literature
lacks the integration of a clear framework capturing the various goals of
public policies. Empirically, GxE models need to be further developed because
the common way of modelling GxE effects fails to adequately capture the
heterogeneous effects public policies may have along the distribution of
genetic propensities (as captured by polygenic indices). We fill these gaps by
proposing a policy classification for GxE research and by offering guidance on
advancing the empirical modelling of policy-informative GxE interplay. While
doing so, we provide a systematic review of existing GxE studies on educational
outcomes exploiting policy reforms or environments that could be targeted by
public policy.

2503.23494,2025-04-09,"DNA and Human Language: Epigenetic Memory and Redundancy in Linear
  Sequence","  DNA is often described as the 'language of life', but whether it possesses
formal linguistic properties remains unresolved. Here, we present the first
empirical evidence that DNA sequences exhibit core linguistic features,
specifically, functional and information redundancy, through comprehensive
analysis of genomic and epigenetic datasets. By mapping DNA sequences into a
linguistic feature space, we demonstrate that fixed-length (41 bp) DNA segments
encode information analogously to human language, with redundancy contributing
to signal stability in aqueous intracellular environments. Moreover, we provide
the first evidence of one-dimensional epigenetic memory, showing that linear
DNA sequences can maintain epigenetic marks such as 6mA methylation,
contrasting with models focusing on epigenetic memory transmission via 3D
chromatin organization[1]. Our tailored linguistic mapping strategy also
addresses persistent challenges in genomic data processing, significantly
improving data cleaning and feature extraction. Together, these findings
establish a conceptual paradigm that bridges molecular information encoding and
linguistic theory, laying the foundation for next-generation large language
models (LLMs) specifically tailored to DNA, marking a shift at the interface of
molecular biology, information theory, and artificial intelligence (AI).

various diseases; however, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. The wet lab
experiments produced relatively rough data, which lack precise ac4C
modification sites, and extracting valuable information from such data remains
a challenge. In this study, we integrate linguistics, traditional machine
learning, and deep learning, establishing a link between the understanding of
mRNA data and natural language processing (NLP). Through our analysis, we
successfully revealed key information about ac4C in mRNA and uncovered the
information storage mechanism of ac4C redundancy on a single sequence. This
redundant information storage method in mRNA facilitates the transmission of
ac4C information and promotes the enrichment of ac4C.

2504.03492,2025-04-07,"Tracking and Distinguishing Slime Mold Solutions to the Traveling
  Salesman Problem through Synchronized Amplification in the Non-Equilibrium
  Steady State","  The plasmodium of the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum serves as a
platform to study information processing in non-equilibrium active matter,
showing complex oscillations and computation despite its simple morphology.
Past experiments used Physarum's shape changes and photoavoidance in a stellate
chip to find approximate solutions to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) for
up to eight cities in linear time. To solve the $N$-city TSP, the organism
elongated and withdrew its $N^2$ branches within the chip lanes, where an
optical feedback loop controlled by a modified Hopfield neural network
selectively illuminated certain lanes to trigger retraction of $N(N-1)$
branches. When the modified Hopfield network stabilizes the illumination
pattern, the organism reaches a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), where $N$
extended branches form a valid TSP solution. The illumination pattern induces a
clear split between two distinct lane groups. Fourier and power spectral
density analyses reveal that in NESS, the solution lanes exhibit lower
frequency, larger-amplitude oscillations, an enhancement of these signals
compared to the higher-frequency, smaller-amplitude fluctuations in the
non-solution lanes. This frequency downconversion and amplification in power
density is a hallmark of a Fr\""ohlich condensate. Synchronization indices for
Physarum-selected solution lanes in the NESS exhibit maximum $S\sim1$, while
non-solution lanes reach minimum $S$-a consistent trend across problem sizes
and tour lengths. Amoeba-inspired algorithms that leverage noise to accelerate
TSP convergence make trade-offs between solution quality and speed, showing up
to $\sqrt N$ scaling in iterations, akin to quantum algorithms like Grover's
search. By tuning power density, frequency shifts, and synchronization, it may
be possible to improve the quality and efficiency of TSP solutions from
Physarum-based biocomputers.

2504.03866,2025-04-08,Addressing ecological challenges from a quantum computing perspective,"  With increased access to data and the advent of computers, the use of
statistical tools and numerical simulations is becoming commonplace for
ecologists. These approaches help improve our understanding of ecological
phenomena and their underlying mechanisms in increasingly complex environments.
However, the development of mathematical and computational tools has made it
possible to study high-dimensional problems up to a certain limit. To overcome
this issue, quantum computers could be used to study ecological problems on a
larger scale by creating new bridges between fields that at first glance appear
to be quite different. We introduce the basic concepts needed to understand
quantum computers, give an overview of their applications, and discuss their
challenges and future opportunities in ecology. Quantum computers will have a
significant impact on ecology by improving the power of statistical tools,
solve intractable problems in networks, and help understand the dynamics of
large systems of interacting species. This innovative computational perspective
could redefine our understanding of species interactions, improve predictive
modeling of distributions, and optimize conservation strategies, thereby
advancing the field of ecology into a new era of discovery and insight.

environments. Despite its promise, the field remains hampered by inconsistent
data formats, variable approaches to error control, and insufficient
interoperability with global data repositories. Recent advances, especially in
false discovery rate (FDR) models and pipeline benchmarking, show that
Crosslinking MS data can reach a reliability that matches the demand of
integrative structural biology. To drive meaningful progress, however, the

remaining barriers, and frames practical next steps. Successful field
harmonisation will enhance the acceptance of Crosslinking MS in the broader
biological community and is critical for the dependability of the data, no

2504.07423,2025-04-11,"Over-Relying on Reliance: Towards Realistic Evaluations of AI-Based
  Clinical Decision Support","  As AI-based clinical decision support (AI-CDS) is introduced in more and more
aspects of healthcare services, HCI research plays an increasingly important
role in designing for complementarity between AI and clinicians. However,
current evaluations of AI-CDS often fail to capture when AI is and is not
useful to clinicians. This position paper reflects on our work and influential
AI-CDS literature to advocate for moving beyond evaluation metrics like Trust,
Reliance, Acceptance, and Performance on the AI's task (what we term the ""trap""
of human-AI collaboration). Although these metrics can be meaningful in some
simple scenarios, we argue that optimizing for them ignores important ways that
AI falls short of clinical benefit, as well as ways that clinicians
successfully use AI. As the fields of HCI and AI in healthcare develop new ways
to design and evaluate CDS tools, we call on the community to prioritize
ecologically valid, domain-appropriate study setups that measure the emergent
forms of value that AI can bring to healthcare professionals.

2504.11352,2025-04-16,"Diagnostic Uncertainty Limits the Potential of Early Warning Signals to
  Identify Epidemic Emergence","  Methods to detect the emergence of infectious diseases, and approach to the
""critical transition"" RE = 1, have to potential to avert substantial disease
burden by facilitating preemptive actions like vaccination campaigns. Early
warning signals (EWS), summary statistics of infection case time series, show
promise in providing such advanced warnings. As EWS are computed on test
positive case data, the accuracy of this underlying data is integral to their
predictive ability, but will vary with changes in the diagnostic test accuracy
and the incidence of the target disease relative to clinically-compatible
background noise. We simulated emergent and null time series as the sum of an
SEIR-generated measles time series, and background noise generated by either
independent draws from a Poisson distribution, or an SEIR simulation with
rubella-like parameters. We demonstrate that proactive outbreak detection with
EWS metrics is resilient to decreasing diagnostic accuracy, so long as
background infections remain proportionally low. Under situations with large,
episodic, noise, imperfect diagnostic tests cannot appropriately discriminate
between emergent and null periods. Not all EWS metrics performed equally: we
find that the mean was the least affected by changes to the noise structure and
magnitude, given a moderately accurate diagnostic test (>= to 95% sensitive and
specific), and the autocovariance and variance were the most predictive when
the noise incidence did not exhibit large temporal variations. In these
situations, diagnostic test accuracy should not be a precursor to the
implementation of an EWS metric-based alert system.

2504.11635,2025-04-17,In Pursuit of Total Reproducibility,"  The vast majority of scientific contributions in the field of computational
systems biology are based on mathematical models. These models can be broadly
classified as either dynamic (kinetic) models or steady-state
(constraint-based) models. They are often described in specific markup
languages whose purpose is to aid in the distribution and standardization of
models. Despite numerous established standards in the field, reproducibility
remains problematic due to the substantial effort required for compliance,
diversity of implementations, and the lack of proportionate rewards for
researchers. This article explores the application of event sourcing - a
software engineering technique where system state is derived from sequential
recorded events - to address reproducibility challenges in computational
systems biology. Event sourcing, exemplified by systems like git, offers a
promising solution by maintaining complete, immutable records of all changes to
a model. Through examples including leader and follower applications, local and
remote computation, and contribution tracking, this work demonstrates how
event-sourced systems can automate standards compliance, provide comprehensive
audit trails, enable perfect replication of processes, facilitate
collaboration, and generate multiple specialized read models from a single
event log. An implementation of the outlined principles has the potential to
transform computational systems biology by providing unprecedented
transparency, reproducibility, and collaborative capabilities, ultimately
accelerating research through more effective model reuse and integration. An
event-sourced approach to modeling in computational systems biology may act as
an example to related disciplines and contribute to ending the reproducibility
crisis plaguing multiple major fields of science.

remains a significant complication of primary cancer and is associated with an
unfavorable prognosis. One approach for improving diagnosis, management, and
outcomes is to implement algorithms based on artificial intelligence for the
automated segmentation of both pre- and post-treatment MRI brain images. Such
algorithms rely on volumetric criteria for lesion identification and treatment
response assessment, which are still not available in clinical practice.
Therefore, it is critical to establish tools for rapid volumetric segmentations
methods that can be translated to clinical practice and that are trained on
high quality annotated data. The BraTS-METS 2025 Lighthouse Challenge aims to
address this critical need by establishing inter-rater and intra-rater
variability in dataset annotation by generating high quality annotated datasets
from four individual instances of segmentation by neuroradiologists while being
recorded on video (two instances doing ""from scratch"" and two instances after
AI pre-segmentation). This high-quality annotated dataset will be used for
testing phase in 2025 Lighthouse challenge and will be publicly released at the
completion of the challenge. The 2025 Lighthouse challenge will also release
the 2023 and 2024 segmented datasets that were annotated using an established
pipeline of pre-segmentation, student annotation, two neuroradiologists
checking, and one neuroradiologist finalizing the process. It builds upon its
previous edition by including post-treatment cases in the dataset. Using these
high-quality annotated datasets, the 2025 Lighthouse challenge plans to test
benchmark algorithms for automated segmentation of pre-and post-treatment brain
metastases (BM), trained on diverse and multi-institutional datasets of MRI
images obtained from patients with brain metastases.

2504.14774,2025-04-22,Defining and finding lifelike entities with a lazy filter,"  Our binary intuitive understanding of life and lifelikeness is good enough
for daily life, but not for research in the natural sciences. Here we propose
an operational definition of lifeness of a particular entity as a scalar,
product of its defining information (algorithmic complexity) integrated over
its lifetime. We provide a parameter-free dynamical filtering algorithm that
can efficiently and on-the-fly fit configurations of entities constituted by
moving particles to a tree structure that can model a wide range of
hierarchical system entities, while extracting and calculating the complexity,
lifespan, and lifeness of the entity and all of its constituting subtrees or
subentities. We simulated 41 interacting particle worlds and found preliminary
evidence suggesting that the lifeness of entities is associated with the
distance to criticality, as roughly measured by the range of the pairwise
interaction forces of the elemental particles of the worlds they inhabit. This
study is a proof of concept that defining, measuring, and quantifying lifeness
is (1) feasible, useful for (2) simplifying theoretical discussions, for (3)
hierarchically assessing biotic properties such as number of hierarchical
levels and predicted longevity and for (4) classifying both artificial and
biological entities, respectively via computer simulations and a combination of
evolutionary and molecular biology approaches.

  Free-ranging Dogs for Bonding with Humans","  Free-ranging dogs constitute approximately 80% of the global dog population.
These dogs are freely breeding and live without direct human supervision,
making them an ideal model system for studying dog-human relationships. Living
in close proximity with humans, free-ranging dogs in India frequently interact
with people, and previous studies suggest that humans are a crucial part of
their social environment. Positive reinforcement in the form of food and
petting is commonly received from humans. In this study, we investigated which
type of reward, food or petting, is more influential in shaping positive social
associations with unfamiliar humans. Field trials were conducted on 61 adult
free-ranging dogs in Nadia district, West Bengal, India. During a
familiarization phase, two unfamiliar individuals each provided either food or
petting to the dogs. This was followed by a choice test in which dogs could
choose between the two individuals. A choice test following the familiarization
phase was conducted on the first 5 days, while only choice tests were conducted
on the subsequent 5 days. Results showed that on the first day, dogs
significantly preferred the individual providing food. However, from the second
day onward, preference for either individual was no different from chance.
These findings suggest that while food is a stronger short-term motivator,
repeated interactions involving either food or petting contribute equally to
the formation of positive social associations over time. This study sheds light
on the dynamics of dog-human relationship development in Indian free-ranging
dog populations and highlights the nuanced role of different types of rewards
in fostering affiliative bonds.

machine populations under real-world conditions is routinely missing from this
framework. Here, we analyze survival and repair patterns in sixty-five million
complex machines to reveal fundamental challenges to our theories of
biomechanical aging. We measure the reliability, survival, and mechanical
failure rates of every privately registered used vehicle in Britain from
2005-2021, using comprehensive samples from 397 million mandatory annual
inspections and billions of accompanying repair records. These data reveal that
vehicle survival patterns are not a fixed outcome of mechanical reliability or
accumulated physical 'wear-and-tear' but display non-aging and anti-aging
patterns of survival. These patterns are robust to multiple reanalyses and
remain after correcting for diverse external and mechanical predictors of
mortality rate using survival forests. These findings challenge the perception
of aging as an inevitable and cumulative physical phenomenon, complicate our
longstanding comparison of organisms to machines, and highlight exciting new
pathways to study the evolution of death in complex systems.

2505.12286,2025-05-20,In-host modeling challenges using population approach methods,"  Non-linear mixed effects models are widely used to estimate parameter
estimates in the field of pharmacometrics across pharmaceutical industry, US
regulatory agencies and academia. The preciseness of the parameter estimate is
evaluated using relative standard error (RSE) with a threshold of <50%
considered as 'precisely estimated'. Here we investigate the use of this metric
alone in Monolix to calibrate a recently published in-host mathematical model
for hepatitis D virus (HDV) with our own longitudinal data obtained from
patients treated with HDV-entry inhibitor bulevirtide (BLV) monotherapy for up
to 96 weeks. We identified substantial discordance between Monolix calibration
output, measured longitudinal data and the HDV model despite the fact that
Monolix parameters had a RSE <50%, suggesting that model parameters were
estimated with precision. Surprisingly, while Monolix suggested precise
parameter estimates based on RSE<50%, the correlation matrix in Monolix
indicated a strong inverse correlation between BLV efficacy and the loss rate
of HDV-infected cells raising identifiability issues. Furthermore, the fits
failed to reproduce HDV kinetics accurately in the majority of patients (i.e.,
poor goodness of fit). Lastly, the estimated pretreatment serum HDV level
varied significantly from measured observations. In summary, we demonstrate
that even when RSE was <50%, other outputs such as the correlation matrix,
confidence intervals and goodness of fit at both the individual and population
level need to be checked for accuracy to accept or refine a proposed model.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and imaging-based techniques have enabled
the extraction of various hemodynamic variables to characterize these flow

of its emergence and the diversity of disciplinary perspectives brought to bear
on the question. Despite significant progress in our understanding of
biological systems, psychology, computation, and information theory, no single
definition for life has yet achieved universal acceptance. This challenge
becomes increasingly urgent as advances in synthetic biology, artificial

means to be alive. We undertook a methodological approach that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to analyze a set of definitions of life provided by a
curated set of cross-disciplinary experts. We used a novel pairwise correlation
analysis to map the definitions into distinct feature vectors, followed by
agglomerative clustering, intra-cluster semantic analysis, and t-SNE projection
to reveal underlying conceptual archetypes. This methodology revealed a
continuous landscape of the themes relating to the definition of life,
suggesting that what has historically been approached as a binary taxonomic
problem should be instead conceived as differentiated perspectives within a
unified conceptual latent space. We offer a new methodological bridge between
reductionist and holistic approaches to fundamental questions in science and
philosophy, demonstrating how computational semantic analysis can reveal
conceptual patterns across disciplinary boundaries, and opening similar
pathways for addressing other contested definitional territories across the

retention, and high metal content pose severe physiological and biochemical
challenges to plant growth. This study evaluates the performance of Solanum
lycopersicum 'Inkspot', a stress-adaptive, anthocyanin-rich tomato variant, in
comparison to its progenitor 'Tiny Tim', under control and simulated lunar
regolith (LHS-2) conditions. A randomized complete block design was used to
assess germination dynamics, morphology, fruit quality, antioxidant activity,
and root architecture across 80 replicates over 65 days in controlled chambers.
Inkspot maintained high germination rates (85% in regolith) with low variation
(CV = 14%) and showed only moderate reductions in height and biomass, while
Tiny Tim suffered a 45% biomass reduction and 60% fruit yield loss. Inkspot
fruits increased anthocyanin content 2.5-fold in regolith, functioning as a
stress-response mechanism and potential bioindicator. Physiological assessments
revealed greater retention of chlorophyll, Fv/Fm efficiency, and stomatal
conductance in Inkspot, correlated with higher SOD and CAT enzyme activity and
lower lipid peroxidation. Root imaging showed Inkspot developed a significantly
larger, more complex root system, while Tiny Tim's roots contracted under

2505.17770,2025-05-26,An Eye for a Treat: Human Gazing Modulates Begging by Free-ranging Dogs,"  Interspecific communication plays a critical role in mediating human-animal
interactions, particularly in contexts involving access to anthropogenic
resources. This study investigates the influence of human gazing on the begging
strategies of free-ranging dogs in urban and peri-urban environments. Begging
behaviour, commonly observed in dogs seeking food from humans, offers insights
into their behavioural flexibility and cognitive attunement to human social
cues. We observed 650 adult dogs in both solitary and group settings to assess
how social context shapes the expression of begging behaviour in free-ranging
dogs. Our findings indicate that solitary dogs beg more frequently than those
in groups, and that female dogs exhibit higher rates of begging, predominantly
through passive strategies. Moreover, dogs modulate their active begging in
response to subtle variations in human gazing and food availability. These
results suggest that passive begging is influenced by stable situational
factors such as sex and group composition, while active begging is more
responsive to immediate environmental cues, including human attentional state.
Collectively, our findings highlight the social competence and behavioural
plasticity of free-ranging dogs in navigating interspecies interactions, and
contribute to a broader understanding of how communicative strategies evolve in
response to social and ecological pressures.

been observed in a large variety of biological systems. It has been argued that
animals in general might perform L\'evy flight motion with power law
distribution of times between two changes of the direction of motion. Here we
study the temporal behaviour of nesting gilts. The time spent by a gilt in a
given form of activity has power law probability distribution without finite
average. Further analysis reveals intermittent eruption of certain periodic
behavioural sequences which are responsible for the scaling behaviour and
indicates the existence of a critical state. We show that this behaviour is in
close analogy with temporal sequences of velocity found in turbulent flows,
where random and regular sequences alternate and form an intermittent sequence.

colloidal charge renormalization. In aqueous solutions containing multivalent
counterions they can lead to charge inversion and flocculation. In biological
systems the correlations account for the organization of cytoskeleton and the
compaction of genetic material. In spite of their ubiquity, the true importance
of electrostatic correlations has become fully appreciated only quite recently.
In this paper, I will review the thermodynamic consequences of electrostatic
correlations in a variety of systems ranging from classical plasmas to
molecular biology.

cond-mat/0210362,2009-11-07,Disease Spreading in Structured Scale-Free Networks,"  We study the spreading of a disease on top of structured scale-free networks
recently introduced. By means of numerical simulations we analyze the SIS and
the SIR models. Our results show that when the connectivity fluctuations of the
network are unbounded whether the epidemic threshold exists strongly depends on
the initial density of infected individuals and the type of epidemiological
model considered. Analytical arguments are provided in order to account for the
observed behavior. We conclude that the peculiar topological features of this
network and the absence of small-world properties determine the dynamics of
epidemic spreading.
"
cond-mat/0211390,2009-11-07,Viral self-assembly as a thermodynamic process,"  The protein shells, or capsids, of all sphere-like viruses adopt icosahedral
symmetry. In the present paper we propose a statistical thermodynamic model for
viral self-assembly. We find that icosahedral symmetry is not expected for
viral capsids constructed from structurally identical protein subunits and that
this symmetry requires (at least) two internal ""switching"" configurations of
the protein. Our results indicate that icosahedral symmetry is not a generic
consequence of free energy minimization but requires optimization of internal
structural parameters of the capsid proteins.
"
cond-mat/0301305,2007-05-23,Icosahedral packing of RNA viral genomes,"  Recent studies reveal that certain viruses package a portion of their genome
in a manner that mirrors the icosahedral symmetry of the protein container, or
capsid. Graph theoretical constraints forbid exact realization of icosahedral
symmetry. This paper proposes a model for the determination of
quasi-icosahedral genome structures and discusses the connection between
genomic structure and viral assembly kinetics.

cond-mat/0309336,2015-06-24,"Universality in the merging dynamics of parametric active contours: a
  study in MRI-based lung segmentation","  Measurement of lung ventilation is one of the most reliable techniques of
diagnosing pulmonary diseases. The time consuming and bias prone traditional
methods using hyperpolarized H${}^{3}$He and ${}^{1}$H magnetic resonance
imageries have recently been improved by an automated technique based on
multiple active contour evolution. Mapping results from an equivalent
thermodynamic model, here we analyse the fundamental dynamics orchestrating the
active contour (AC) method. We show that the numerical method is inherently
connected to the universal scaling behavior of a classical nucleation-like
dynamics. The favorable comparison of the exponent values with the theoretical
model render further credentials to our claim.
"
cond-mat/0309462,2009-11-10,Epidemic Incidence in Correlated Complex Networks,"  We introduce a numerical method to solve epidemic models on the underlying
topology of complex networks. The approach exploits the mean-field like rate
equations describing the system and allows to work with very large system
sizes, where Monte Carlo simulations are useless due to memory needs. We then
study the SIR epidemiological model on assortative networks, providing
numerical evidence of the absence of epidemic thresholds. Besides, the time
profiles of the populations are analyzed. Finally, we stress that the present
method would allow to solve arbitrary epidemic-like models provided that they
can be described by mean-field rate equations.

evident support by our study of the Bishop--Peyrard model of DNA thermal
denaturation.

they apply their methods to biology, economics, or sociology.
"
cond-mat/0311350,2015-06-24,Pore dynamics of osmotically stressed vesicles,"  We present a theory for pore dynamics of osmotically stressed vesicles. When
a liposome with an internal concentration of solute is placed inside a
solute-depleted medium, an osmotic flow of solvent through the lipid bilayer
leads to swelling of vesicle and to increase in membrane surface tension. This
can result in membrane rupture and opening of thermal pores. Depending on the
internal concentration of solute and the size of the vesicle, pores can close
rapidly or be long-lived. We find that the life span of the long-lived pores
scales non-trivially with the size of the liposome. Closure of the long-lived
pore is followed by a rapid flicker-like opening and closing of short-lived
pores. Our model is consistent with the observation of long-lived pores in red
blood cell ghosts.
"
cond-mat/0402581,2009-11-10,Dictionary based methods for information extraction,"  In this paper we present a general method for information extraction that
exploits the features of data compression techniques. We first define and focus
our attention on the so-called ""dictionary"" of a sequence. Dictionaries are
intrinsically interesting and a study of their features can be of great
usefulness to investigate the properties of the sequences they have been
extracted from (e.g. DNA strings). We then describe a procedure of string
comparison between dictionary-created sequences (or ""artificial texts"") that
gives very good results in several contexts. We finally present some results on
self-consistent classification problems.
"
cond-mat/0404054,2009-11-10,Fitness for Synchronization of Network Motifs,"  We study the phase synchronization of Kuramoto's oscillators in small parts
of networks known as motifs. We first report on the system dynamics for the
case of a scale-free network and show the existence of a non-trivial critical
point. We compute the probability that network motifs synchronize, and find
that the fitness for synchronization correlates well with motif's
interconnectedness and structural complexity. Possible implications for present
debates about network evolution in biological and other systems are discussed.
"
cond-mat/0412443,2009-11-10,Core percolation and onset of complexity in Boolean networks,"  The determination and classification of fixed points of large Boolean
networks is addressed in terms of constraint satisfaction problem. We develop a
general simplification scheme that, removing all those variables and functions
belonging to trivial logical cascades, returns the computational core of the
network. The onset of an easy-to-complex regulatory phase is introduced as a
function of the parameters of the model, identifying both theoretically and
algorithmically the relevant regulatory variables.
"
cond-mat/0412493,2007-05-23,Active transport: A kinetic description based on thermodynamic grounds,"  We show that active transport processes in biological systems can be
understood through a local equilibrium description formulated at the mesoscale,
the scale to describe stochastic processes. This new approach uses the method
established by nonequilibrium thermodynamics to account for the irreversible
processes occurring at this scale and provides nonlinear kinetic equations for
the rates in terms of the driving forces. The results show that the application
domain of nonequilibrium thermodynamics method to biological systems goes
beyond the linear domain. A model for transport of Ca$^{2+}$ by the
Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase, coupled to the hydrolysis of adenosine-triphosphate is
analyzed in detail showing that it depends on the reaction Gibbs energy in a
non-linear way. Our results unify thermodynamic and kinetic descriptions,
thereby opening new perspectives in the study of different transport phenomena
in biological systems.
"
cond-mat/0505704,2007-05-23,Renewal processes and fluctuation analysis of molecular motor stepping,"  We model the dynamics of a processive or rotary molecular motor using a
renewal processes, in line with the work initiated by Svoboda, Mitra and Block.
We apply a functional technique to compute different types of multiple-time
correlation functions of the renewal process, which have applications to
bead-assay experiments performed both with processive molecular motors, such as
myosin V and kinesin, and rotary motors, such as F1-ATPase.
"
cond-mat/0510650,2009-11-11,"Complex networks generated by the Penna bit-string model: Emergence of
  small-world and assortative mixing","  The Penna bit-string model successfully encompasses many phenomena of
population evolution, including inheritance, mutation, evolution and ageing. If
we consider social interactions among individuals in the Penna model, the
population will form a complex network. In this paper, we first modify the
Verhulst factor to control only the birth rate, and introduce activity-based
preferential reproduction of offspring in the Penna model. The social
interactions among individuals are generated by both inheritance and
activity-based preferential increase. Then we study the properties of the
complex network generated by the modified Penna model. We find that the
resulting complex network has a small-world effect and the assortative mixing
property.
"
cond-mat/0510820,2007-05-23,"Dielectrophoresis of nanoscale dsDNA and humidity effects on its
  electrical conductivity","  The dielectrophoresis method for trapping and attaching nanoscale
double-stranded DNA between nanoelectrodes was developed. The method gives a
high yield of trapping single or a few molecules only which enables transport
measurements at the single molecule level. Electrical conductivity of
individual 140-nm-long DNA molecules was measured, showing insulating behavior
in dry conditions. In contrast, clear enhancement of conductivity was observed
in moist conditions, relating to the interplay between the conformation of DNA
molecules and their conductivity.
"
cond-mat/0602562,2007-05-23,Epidemic variability in complex networks,"  We study numerically the variability of the outbreak of diseases on complex
networks. We use a SI model to simulate the disease spreading at short times,
in homogeneous and in scale-free networks. In both cases, we study the effect
of initial conditions on the epidemic's dynamics and its variability. The
results display a time regime during which the prevalence exhibits a large
sensitivity to noise. We also investigate the dependence of the infection time
on nodes' degree and distance to the seed. In particular, we show that the
infection time of hubs have large fluctuations which limit their reliability as
early-detection stations. Finally, we discuss the effect of the multiplicity of
shortest paths between two nodes on the infection time. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the existence of even longer paths reduces the average
infection time. These different results could be of use for the design of
time-dependent containment strategies.
"
cond-mat/0606378,2007-05-23,"Complex noise in diffusion-limited reactions of replicating and
  competing species","  We derive exact Langevin-type equations governing quasispecies dynamics. The
inherent multiplicative noise has both real and imaginary parts. The numerical
simulation of the underlying complex stochastic partial differential equations
is carried out employing the Cholesky decomposition for the noise covariance
matrix. This noise produces unavoidable spatio-temporal density fluctuations
about the mean field value. In two dimensions, the fluctuations are suppressed
only when the diffusion time scale is much smaller than the amplification time
scale for the master species.
"
cond-mat/0609378,2016-08-31,"Single-molecule experiments in biological physics: methods and
  applications","  I review single-molecule experiments (SME) in biological physics. Recent
technological developments have provided the tools to design and build
scientific instruments of high enough sensitivity and precision to manipulate
and visualize individual molecules and measure microscopic forces. Using SME it
is possible to: manipulate molecules one at a time and measure distributions
describing molecular properties; characterize the kinetics of biomolecular
reactions and; detect molecular intermediates. SME provide the additional
information about thermodynamics and kinetics of biomolecular processes. This
complements information obtained in traditional bulk assays. In SME it is also
possible to measure small energies and detect large Brownian deviations in
biomolecular reactions, thereby offering new methods and systems to scrutinize
the basic foundations of statistical mechanics. This review is written at a
very introductory level emphasizing the importance of SME to scientists
interested in knowing the common playground of ideas and the interdisciplinary
topics accessible by these techniques. The review discusses SME from an
experimental perspective, first exposing the most common experimental
methodologies and later presenting various molecular systems where such
techniques have been applied. I briefly discuss experimental techniques such as
atomic-force microscopy (AFM), laser optical tweezers (LOT), magnetic tweezers
(MT), biomembrane force probe (BFP) and single-molecule fluorescence (SMF). I
then present several applications of SME to the study of nucleic acids (DNA,
RNA and DNA condensation), proteins (protein-protein interactions, protein
folding and molecular motors). Finally, I discuss applications of SME to the
study of the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of small systems and the
experimental verification of fluctuation theorems. I conclude with a discussion
of open questions and future perspectives.
"
cond-mat/0612433,2009-11-11,"Measuring the energy landscape roughness and the transition state
  location of biomolecules using single molecule mechanical unfolding
  experiments","  Single molecule mechanical unfolding experiments are beginning to provide
profiles of the complex energy landscape of biomolecules. In order to obtain
reliable estimates of the energy landscape characteristics it is necessary to
combine the experimental measurements with sound theoretical models and
simulations. Here, we show how by using temperature as a variable in mechanical
unfolding of biomolecules in laser optical tweezer or AFM experiments the
roughness of the energy landscape can be measured without making any
assumptions about the underlying reaction oordinate. The efficacy of the
formalism is illustrated by reviewing experimental results that have directly
measured roughness in a protein-protein complex. The roughness model can also
be used to interpret experiments on forced-unfolding of proteins in which
temperature is varied. Estimates of other aspects of the energy landscape such
as free energy barriers or the transition state (TS) locations could depend on
the precise model used to analyze the experimental data. We illustrate the
inherent difficulties in obtaining the transition state location from loading
rate or force-dependent unfolding rates. Because the transition state moves as
the force or the loading rate is varied it is in general difficult to invert
the experimental data unless the curvature at the top of the one dimensional
free energy profile is large, i.e the barrier is sharp. The independence of the
TS location on force holds good only for brittle or hard biomolecules whereas
the TS location changes considerably if the molecule is soft or plastic. We
also comment on the usefulness of extension of the molecule as a surrogate
reaction coordinate especially in the context of force-quench refolding of
proteins and RNA.
"
cond-mat/0703129,2007-05-23,"Reaction-diffusion processes and metapopulation models in heterogeneous
  networks","  Dynamical reaction-diffusion processes and meta-population models are
standard modeling approaches for a wide variety of phenomena in which local
quantities - such as density, potential and particles - diffuse and interact
according to the physical laws. Here, we study the behavior of two basic
reaction-diffusion processes ($B \to A$ and $A+B \to 2B$) defined on networks
with heterogeneous topology and no limit on the nodes' occupation number. We
investigate the effect of network topology on the basic properties of the
system's phase diagram and find that the network heterogeneity sustains the
reaction activity even in the limit of a vanishing density of particles,
eventually suppressing the critical point in density driven phase transitions,
whereas phase transition and critical points, independent of the particle
density, are not altered by topological fluctuations. This work lays out a
theoretical and computational microscopic framework for the study of a wide
range of realistic meta-populations models and agent-based models that include
the complex features of real world networks.
"
cond-mat/9805044,2007-05-23,"Phase Disorder Effects in a Cellular Automaton Model of Epidemic
  Propagation","  A deterministic cellular automaton rule defined on the Moore neighbourhood is
studied as a model of epidemic propagation. The directed nature of the
interaction between cells allows one to introduce the dependence on a disorder
parameter that determines the fraction of ``in-phase'' cells. Phase-disorder is
shown to produce peculiar changes in the dynamical and statistical properties
of the different evolution regimes obtained by varying the infection and the
immunization periods. In particular, the finite-velocity spreading of
perturbations, characterizing chaotic evolution, can be prevented by
localization effects induced by phase-disorder, that may also yield spatial
isotropy of the infection propagation as a statistical effect. Analogously, the
structure of phase-synchronous ordered patterns is rapidly lost as soon as
phase-disorder is increased, yielding a defect-mediated turbulent regime.

cs/0308032,2011-11-09,"Evaluation of text data mining for database curation: lessons learned
  from the KDD Challenge Cup","  MOTIVATION: The biological literature is a major repository of knowledge.
Many biological databases draw much of their content from a careful curation of
this literature. However, as the volume of literature increases, the burden of
curation increases. Text mining may provide useful tools to assist in the
curation process. To date, the lack of standards has made it impossible to
determine whether text mining techniques are sufficiently mature to be useful.
  RESULTS: We report on a Challenge Evaluation task that we created for the
Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) Challenge Cup. We provided a training
corpus of 862 articles consisting of journal articles curated in FlyBase, along
with the associated lists of genes and gene products, as well as the relevant
data fields from FlyBase. For the test, we provided a corpus of 213 new
(`blind') articles; the 18 participating groups provided systems that flagged
articles for curation, based on whether the article contained experimental
evidence for gene expression products. We report on the the evaluation results
and describe the techniques used by the top performing groups.

cs/0505086,2011-11-09,"On the Ancestral Compatibility of Two Phylogenetic Trees with Nested
  Taxa","  Compatibility of phylogenetic trees is the most important concept underlying
widely-used methods for assessing the agreement of different phylogenetic trees
with overlapping taxa and combining them into common supertrees to reveal the
tree of life. The notion of ancestral compatibility of phylogenetic trees with
nested taxa was introduced by Semple et al in 2004. In this paper we analyze in
detail the meaning of this compatibility from the points of view of the local
structure of the trees, of the existence of embeddings into a common supertree,
and of the joint properties of their cluster representations. Our analysis
leads to a very simple polynomial-time algorithm for testing this
compatibility, which we have implemented and is freely available for download
from the BioPerl collection of Perl modules for computational biology.

cs/0612091,2008-12-23,Bias in the journal impact factor,"  The ISI journal impact factor (JIF) is based on a sample that may represent
half the whole-of-life citations to some journals, but a small fraction (<10%)
of the citations accruing to other journals. This disproportionate sampling
means that the JIF provides a misleading indication of the true impact of
journals, biased in favour of journals that have a rapid rather than a
prolonged impact. Many journals exhibit a consistent pattern of citation
accrual from year to year, so it may be possible to adjust the JIF to provide a
more reliable indication of a journal's impact.

math/0309255,2013-01-07,"Catastrophe Management and Inter-Reserve Distance for Marine Reserve
  Networks","  We consider the optimal spacing between marine reserves for maximising the
viability of a species occupying a reserve network. The closer the networks are
placed together, the higher the probability of colonisation of an empty reserve
by an occupied reserve, thus increasing population viability. However, the
closer the networks are placed together, the higher the probability that a
catastrophe will cause extinction of the species in both reserves, thus
decreasing population viability. Using a simple discrete-time Markov chain
model for the presence or absence of the species in each reserve we determine
the distance between the two reserves which provides the optimal trade-off
between these processes, resulting in maximum viability of the species.
"
math/0607466,2016-08-16,Global Stabilization of a Class of Partially Known Positive Systems,"  In this report we deal with the problem of global output feedback
stabilization of a class of $n$-dimensional nonlinear positive systems
possessing a one-dimensional unknown, though measured, part. We first propose
our main result, an output feedback control procedure, taking advantage of
measurements of the uncertain part, able to globally stabilize the system
towards an adjustable equilibrium point in the interior of the positive
orthant. Though quite general, this result is based on hypotheses that might be
difficult to check in practice. Then in a second step, through a Theorem on a
class of positive systems linking the existence of a strongly positive
equillibrium to its global asymptotic stability, we propose other hypotheses
for our main result to hold. These new hypotheses are more restrictive but much
simpler to check. Some illustrative examples, highlighting both the potential
complex open loop dynamics (multi-stability, limit cycle, chaos) of the
considered systems and the interest of the control procedure, conclude this
report.
"
nlin/0010012,2009-10-31,Small world effect in an epidemiological model,"  A model for the spread of an infection is analyzed for different population
structures. The interactions within the population are described by small world
networks, ranging from ordered lattices to random graphs. For the more ordered
systems, there is a fluctuating endemic state of low infection. At a finite
value of the disorder of the network, we find a transition to self-sustained
oscillations in the size of the infected subpopulation.
"
nlin/0311032,2009-09-29,Mathematical Models of Bipolar Disorder,"  We use limit cycle oscillators to model Bipolar II disorder, which is
characterized by alternating hypomanic and depressive episodes and afflicts
about one percent of the United States adult population. We consider two
nonlinear oscillator models of a single bipolar patient. In both frameworks, we
begin with an untreated individual and examine the mathematical effects and
resulting biological consequences of treatment. We also briefly consider the
dynamics of interacting bipolar II individuals using weakly-coupled,
weakly-damped harmonic oscillators. We discuss how the proposed models can be
used as a framework for refined models that incorporate additional biological
data. We conclude with a discussion of possible generalizations of our work, as
there are several biologically-motivated extensions that can be readily
incorporated into the series of models presented here.
"
nlin/0402006,2011-11-10,Updating Schemes in Random Boolean Networks: Do They Really Matter?,"  In this paper we try to end the debate concerning the suitability of
different updating schemes in random Boolean networks (RBNs). We quantify for
the first time loose attractors in asyncrhonous RBNs, which allows us to
analyze the complexity reduction related to different updating schemes. We also
report that all updating schemes yield very similar critical stability values,
meaning that the ""edge of chaos"" does not depend much on the updating scheme.
After discussion, we conclude that synchonous RBNs are justifiable theoretical
models of biological networks.

nlin/0512048,2007-05-23,"Modeling Endogenous Social Networks: the Example of Emergence and
  Stability of Cooperation without Refusal","  Aggregated phenomena in social sciences and economics are highly dependent on
the way individuals interact. To help understanding the interplay between
socio-economic activities and underlying social networks, this paper studies a
sequential prisoner's dilemma with binary choice. It proposes an analytical and
computational insight about the role of endogenous networks in emergence and
sustainability of cooperation and exhibits an alternative to the choice and
refusal mechanism that is often proposed to explain cooperation. The study
focuses on heterogeneous equilibriums and emergence of cooperation from an
all-defector state that are the two stylized facts that this model successfully
reconstructs.
"
nlin/0604007,2015-06-26,Fractional Generalization of Gradient Systems,"  We consider a fractional generalization of gradient systems. We use
differential forms and exterior derivatives of fractional orders. Examples of
fractional gradient systems are considered. We describe the stationary states
of these systems.
"
nlin/0608028,2016-09-08,Universality in Complex Networks: Random Matrix Analysis,"  We apply random matrix theory to complex networks. We show that nearest
neighbor spacing distribution of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices of
various model networks, namely scale-free, small-world and random networks
follow universal Gaussian orthogonal ensemble statistics of random matrix
theory. Secondly we show an analogy between the onset of small-world behavior,
quantified by the structural properties of networks, and the transition from
Poisson to Gaussian orthogonal ensemble statistics, quantified by Brody
parameter characterizing a spectral property. We also present our analysis for
a protein-protein interaction network in budding yeast.
"
physics/0007070,2011-11-10,"Predictability, complexity and learning","  We define {\em predictive information} $I_{\rm pred} (T)$ as the mutual
information between the past and the future of a time series. Three
qualitatively different behaviors are found in the limit of large observation
times $T$: $I_{\rm pred} (T)$ can remain finite, grow logarithmically, or grow
as a fractional power law. If the time series allows us to learn a model with a
finite number of parameters, then $I_{\rm pred} (T)$ grows logarithmically with
a coefficient that counts the dimensionality of the model space. In contrast,
power--law growth is associated, for example, with the learning of infinite
parameter (or nonparametric) models such as continuous functions with
smoothness constraints. There are connections between the predictive
information and measures of complexity that have been defined both in learning
theory and in the analysis of physical systems through statistical mechanics
and dynamical systems theory. Further, in the same way that entropy provides
the unique measure of available information consistent with some simple and
plausible conditions, we argue that the divergent part of $I_{\rm pred} (T)$
provides the unique measure for the complexity of dynamics underlying a time
series. Finally, we discuss how these ideas may be useful in different problems
in physics, statistics, and biology.
"
physics/0007096,2007-05-23,"Re-examination of the ""3/4-law"" of Metabolism","  We examine the scaling law $B \propto M^{\alpha}$ which connects organismal
metabolic rate $B$ with organismal mass $M$, where $\alpha$ is commonly held to
be 3/4. Since simple dimensional analysis suggests $\alpha=2/3$, we consider
this to be a null hypothesis testable by empirical studies. We re-analyze data
sets for mammals and birds compiled by Heusner, Bennett and Harvey, Bartels,
Hemmingsen, Brody, and Kleiber, and find little evidence for rejecting
$\alpha=2/3$ in favor of $\alpha=3/4$. For mammals, we find a possible
breakdown in scaling for larger masses reflected in a systematic increase in
$\alpha$. We also review theoretical justifications of $\alpha=3/4$ based on
dimensional analysis, nutrient-supply networks, and four-dimensional biology.
We find that present theories for $\alpha=3/4$ require assumptions that render
them unconvincing for rejecting the null hypothesis that $\alpha=2/3$.

physics/0011002,2016-09-08,A Historical Perspective on Cancer,"  It is proposed that cancer results from the breakdown of universal control
mechanisms which developed in mutual association as part of the historical

By systematically comparing the genomes of uni-celled with multi-celled
organisms, one might be able to identify the most promising sites for
intervention aimed at restoring the damaged control mechanisms and thereby
arresting the cancer.
"
physics/0101087,2018-11-06,Kinetic model of DNA replication in eukaryotic organisms,"  We formulate a kinetic model of DNA replication that quantitatively describes
recent results on DNA replication in the in vitro system of Xenopus laevis
prior to the mid-blastula transition. The model describes well a large amount
of different data within a simple theoretical framework. This allows one, for
the first time, to determine the parameters governing the DNA replication
program in a eukaryote on a genome-wide basis. In particular, we have
determined the frequency of origin activation in time and space during the cell
cycle. Although we focus on a specific stage of development, this model can
easily be adapted to describe replication in many other organisms, including
budding yeast.

changes in physical theories are needed. I provide an elementary demonstration
that these deductions are mistaken.

to Ultraviolet Radiation"" of A.M. Delprato et al., Phys. Rev. Lett 87, 158102
(2001) we point out that their observed ring pattern formation by colonies of
soil bacteria Bacillus subtilis exposed to ultra violet (UV) radiation might be
caused by the artificial confinement of motile bacteria evolved to live in a
3-dimensional environment to a 2-dimensional geometry. We propose that to
investigate the reaction of Bacillus subtilis to UV radiation coming from

"
physics/0210030,2009-11-07,Modeling oscillatory Microtubule--Polymerization,"  Polymerization of microtubules is ubiquitous in biological cells and under
certain conditions it becomes oscillatory in time. Here simple reaction models
are analyzed that capture such oscillations as well as the length distribution
of microtubules. We assume reaction conditions that are stationary over many
oscillation periods, and it is a Hopf bifurcation that leads to a persistent
oscillatory microtubule polymerization in these models. Analytical expressions
are derived for the threshold of the bifurcation and the oscillation frequency
in terms of reaction rates as well as typical trends of their parameter
dependence are presented. Both, a catastrophe rate that depends on the density
of {\it guanosine triphosphate} (GTP) liganded tubulin dimers and a delay
reaction, such as the depolymerization of shrinking microtubules or the decay
of oligomers, support oscillations. For a tubulin dimer concentration below the
threshold oscillatory microtubule polymerization occurs transiently on the
route to a stationary state, as shown by numerical solutions of the model
equations. Close to threshold a so--called amplitude equation is derived and it
is shown that the bifurcation to microtubule oscillations is supercritical.
"
physics/0301072,2007-05-23,Autoregulation of the total number of cells in culture,"  According to the universally accepted concept of the development of life on
the Earth, multicellular organisms initially emerged as a result of either the
union of identical unicellular organisms with the following functional
differentiation, or the union of symbionts, in which there already was a
certain simple functional separation. However, in either case the progenitors
of multicellular organisms were ensembles, communities of unicellular
organisms. For a certain number of unicellular organisms to be treated as an
ensemble, there must be some interconnection between its members. Colonies of
mechanically connected unicellular organisms were a later, more advanced stage;
here, unicellular organisms living separately are considered. Such
interconnection must, in particular, limit from above the total numbers of the
members of the ensemble, because an excessive increase in these numbers could
disturb the connections between members of the ensemble to the extent of its
destruction. In addition, too large numbers of members in the ensemble could
lead to nutrient depletion in its habitat. One can assume that such
interconnection between unicellular organisms was evolutionarily developed and
genetically fixed. I assumed that modern unicellular organisms retain such an
ability to regulate their total numbers. The validity of this assumption was
tested in experiments, whose results are presented in this paper.
"
physics/0303121,2007-05-23,"On physical nature of radiation regulating quantity of cells in
  population","  It is shown, that spontaneous ultraviolet radiation of cells (infusoria)
plays the role of agent, restricting the upper limit of the quantity of cells
in quasi-stationary phase of cultire's development. The spectral region of this
radiation defined experimentally occurred to be in the range of 200-290 nm. As
the filter cutting off the short wave length part of the spectrum (below 290nm)
1 mm thick plexiglas has been used, while as the filters transmitting short
wave part of the spectrum - 5 mkm thick fluorostatic film or 1 mm thick optical
quartz has been selected. It has been shown, that dynamics of development of

spontaneous ultraviolet radiation of the cells. Conclusion has been made, that
superweak chemiluminescence of the cells is not a worthless metabolism product,
but plays significant biological role.

physics/0306156,2007-05-23,Role of Polymer Loops in DNA Replication,"  Loop formation in long molecules occurs many places in nature, from solutions
of carbon nanotubes to polymers inside a cell. In this article, we review
theoretical studies of the static and dynamic properties of polymer loops. For
example, long polymers must search many configurations to find a ""target""
binding site, while short polymers are stiff and resist bending. In between,
there is an optimal loop size, which balances the entropy of long loops against
the energetic cost of short loops. We show that such simple pictures of loop
formation can explain several long-standing observations in DNA replication,
quantitatively.

  As Evidence of Spatially-Organised Membrane Flows","  I show the assumed Bilayer structure of cell membranes is Topologically
falsified by known aminophospholipid dynamics in metabolically-active, Far from
Equilibrium cells. The sensitivity of lipid and cytoplasmic flows to
temperature, surfactants, viscosity and the gravity vector are used to suggest
that rather than being random viscous fluids as currently assumed, both are
actually spatially-organised by convective and shear driven mechanisms in vivo.
I show how protein-lipid feedback provokes a Gestalt Shift in Cell Mechanics by
demonstrating that the primary forces involved in shape changes are generated
by bifurcations in fluid flow Topology, which induce affine deformations of the
cytoskeletal lattice. The feedback model allows the transduction of
Gravitational information into biological form, is universally applicable, and
provides a rationale for Homeoviscous Adaptation, and the extensive lipid
polymorphism observed in Nature.

physics/0405134,2016-09-08,"Folding Trp-cage to NMR resolution native structure using a
  coarse-grained model","  We develop a coarse-grained protein model with a simplified amino acid
interaction potential. We perform discrete molecular dynamics folding
simulations of a small 20 residue protein - Trp-cage - from a fully extended
conformation. We demonstrate the ability of the Trp-cage model to consistently
reach conformations within 2angstrom backbone root-mean-square distance (RMSD)
from the corresponding NMR structures. The minimum RMSD of Trp-cage
conformations in the simulation can be smaller than 1.00angstrom. Our findings
suggest that, at least for the case of Trp-cage, a detailed all-atom protein
model with a physical molecular mechanics force field is not necessary to reach
the native state of a protein. Our results also suggest that the success
folding Trp-cage in our simulations and in the reported all-atom molecular
mechanics simulations studies may be mainly due to the special stabilizing
features specific to this miniprotein.
"
physics/0504084,2007-05-23,Fluctuations in type IV pilus retraction,"  The type IV pilus retraction motor is found in many important bacterial
pathogens. It is the strongest known linear motor protein and is required for
bacterial infectivity. We characterize the dynamics of type IV pilus retraction
in terms of a stochastic chemical reaction model. We find that a two state
model can describe the experimental force velocity relation and qualitative
dependence of ATP concentration. The results indicate that the dynamics is
limited by an ATP-dependent step at low load and a force-dependent step at high
load, and that at least one step is effectively irreversible in the measured
range of forces. The irreversible nature of the sub-step(s) lead to interesting
predictions for future experiments: We find different parameterizations with
mathematically identical force velocity relations but different fluctuations
(diffusion constant). We also find a longer elementary step compared to an
earlier analysis, which agrees better with known facts about the structure of
the pilus filament and energetic considerations. We conclude that more
experimental data is needed, and that further retraction experiments are likely
to resolve interesting details and give valuable insights into the PilT
machinery. In light of our findings, the fluctuations of the retraction
dynamics emerge as a key property to be studied in future experiments.

physics/0508160,2007-05-23,SIR dynamics in structured populations with heterogeneous connectivity,"  Most epidemic models assume equal mixing among members of a population. An
alternative approach is to model a population as random network in which
individuals may have heterogeneous connectivity. This paper builds on previous
research by describing the exact dynamical behavior of epidemics as they occur
in random networks. A system of nonlinear differential equations is presented
which describes the behavior of epidemics spreading through random networks
with arbitrary degree distributions. The degree distribution is observed to
have significant impact on both the final size and time scale of epidemics.

physics/0508228,2016-09-08,Abrupt structural transitions involving functionally optimal networks,"  We show analytically that abrupt structural transitions can arise in
functionally optimal networks, driven by small changes in the level of
transport congestion. Our findings are based on an exactly solvable model
system which mimics a variety of biological and social networks. Our results
offer an explanation as to why such diverse sets of network structures arise in
Nature (e.g. fungi) under essentially the same environmental conditions. As a
by-product of this work, we introduce a novel renormalization scheme involving
`cost motifs' which describes analytically the average shortest path across
multiple-ring-and-hub networks.

q-bio/0310035,2007-05-23,Why humans die -- an unsolved biological problem,"  Mortality is an instrument of natural selection. Evolutionary motivated
theories imply its irreversibility and life history dependence. This is
inconsistent with mortality data for protected populations. Accurate analysis
yields mortality law, which is specific for their evolutionary unprecedented
conditions, yet universal for species as evolutionary remote as humans and
flies. The law is exact, instantaneous, reversible, stepwise, and allows for a
rapid (within less than two years for humans) and significant mortality
decrease at any (but very old) age.
"
q-bio/0311001,2007-05-23,Mathematical models of haploinsufficiency,"  We study simple mathematical models of gene expression to explore the
possible origins of haploinsufficiency (HI). In a diploid organism, each gene
exists in two copies and when one of these is mutated, the amount of proteins
synthesized is reduced and may fall below a threshold level for the onset of
some desired activity. This can give rise to HI, a manifestation of which is in
the form of a disease. We consider both deterministic and stochastic models of
gene expression and suggest possible scenarios for the occurrence of HI in the
two cases. In the stochastic case, random fluctuations around the mean protein
level give rise to a finite probability that the protein level falls below a
threshold. Increased gene copy number and faster gene expression kinetics
reduce the variance around the mean protein level. The difference between slow
and fast gene expression kinetics, as regards response to a signaling gradient,
is further pointed out. The majority of results reported in the paper are
derived analytically.

The paper also proposes an encoding scheme for the statistics of Lorentzian

process of DNA transcription, effecting the opening of the double chain needed
for RNA Polymerase to be able to copy the genetic code. Some models have been
proposed to model the relevant DNA dynamics in terms of a reduced number of

non-salt water and of a great deal (~5-10%) of abiogenic organics, a great
diversity of conditions, which are unthinkable for the Earth, were realized
more than once. They were caused by global electrochemical processes in the
magnetic field presence what could entail an absolute enantiomeric synthesis.

q-bio/0401014,2009-11-10,"Lattice gas cellular automata model for rippling and aggregation in
  myxobacteria","  A lattice-gas cellular automaton (LGCA) model is used to simulate rippling
and aggregation in myxobacteria. An efficient way of representing cells of
different cell size, shape and orientation is presented that may be easily
extended to model later stages of fruiting body formation. This LGCA model is
designed to investigate whether a refractory period, a minimum response time, a
maximum oscillation period and non-linear dependence of reversals of cells on
C-factor are necessary assumptions for rippling. It is shown that a refractory
period of 2-3 minutes, a minimum response time of up to 1 minute and no maximum
oscillation period best reproduce rippling in the experiments of {\it
Myxoccoccus xanthus}. Non-linear dependence of reversals on C-factor is
critical at high cell density. Quantitative simulations demonstrate that the
increase in wavelength of ripples when a culture is diluted with non-signaling
cells can be explained entirely by the decreased density of C-signaling cells.
This result further supports the hypothesis that levels of C-signaling
quantitatively depend on and modulate cell density. Analysis of the
interpenetrating high density waves shows the presence of a phase shift
analogous to the phase shift of interpenetrating solitons. Finally, a model for
swarming, aggregation and early fruiting body formation is presented.

may deviate considerably from the true probabilities p_i. We propose a method
to infer rank-ordered true probabilities r_i from measured frequencies M_i. We
show that the rank-ordered probabilities provide important informations on the

"
q-bio/0403018,2009-11-10,The Importance of DNA Repair in Tumor Suppression,"  The transition from a normal to cancerous cell requires a number of highly
specific mutations that affect cell cycle regulation, apoptosis,
differentiation, and many other cell functions. One hallmark of cancerous
genomes is genomic instability, with mutation rates far greater than those of
normal cells. In microsatellite instability (MIN tumors), these are often
caused by damage to mismatch repair genes, allowing further mutation of the
genome and tumor progression. These mutation rates may lie near the error
catastrophe found in the quasispecies model of adaptive RNA genomes, suggesting
that further increasing mutation rates will destroy cancerous genomes. However,
recent results have demonstrated that DNA genomes exhibit an error threshold at
mutation rates far lower than their conservative counterparts. Furthermore,
while the maximum viable mutation rate in conservative systems increases
indefinitely with increasing master sequence fitness, the semiconservative
threshold plateaus at a relatively low value. This implies a paradox, wherein
inaccessible mutation rates are found in viable tumor cells. In this paper, we
address this paradox, demonstrating an isomorphism between the conservatively
replicating (RNA) quasispecies model and the semiconservative (DNA) model with
post-methylation DNA repair mechanisms impaired. Thus, as DNA repair becomes
inactivated, the maximum viable mutation rate increases smoothly to that of a
conservatively replicating system on a transformed landscape, with an upper
bound that is dependent on replication rates. We postulate that inactivation of
post-methylation repair mechanisms are fundamental to the progression of a
tumor cell and hence these mechanisms act as a method for prevention and
destruction of cancerous genomes.

q-bio/0406018,2009-11-10,"Fluctuations of Complex Networks: Electrical Properties of Single
  Protein Nanodevices","  We present for the first time a complex network approach to the study of the
electrical properties of single protein devices. In particular, we consider an
electronic nanobiosensor based on a G-protein coupled receptor. By adopting a
coarse grain description, the protein is modeled as a complex network of
elementary impedances. The positions of the alpha-carbon atoms of each amino
acid are taken as the nodes of the network. The amino acids are assumed to
interact electrically among them. Consequently, a link is drawn between any
pair of nodes neighboring in space within a given distance and an elementary
impedance is associated with each link. The value of this impedance can be
related to the physical and chemical properties of the amino acid pair and to
their relative distance. Accordingly, the conformational changes of the
receptor induced by the capture of the ligand, are translated into a variation
of its electrical properties. Stochastic fluctuations in the value of the
elementary impedances of the network, which mimic different physical effects,
have also been considered. Preliminary results concerning the impedance
spectrum of the network and its fluctuations are presented and discussed for
different values of the model parameters.

axes, and in particular show that two rotational joints rigidly joined by a bar
and each with 3 degrees of freedom always forms a 5-dimensional system. We
introduce the concept of reduced redundancy in a dependent set of projective
Lines, and argue that reduced redundancy in the axes of a body position
increases injury risk. We apply this to a simple two-joint model of bowling in
cricket, and show by analysis of some experimental data that reduced redundancy
around ball release is observed in some cases.

q-bio/0406026,2007-05-23,Phase synchronization in cerebral hemodynamics,"  A healthy human brain is perfused with blood flowing laminarly through
cerebral vessels, providing brain tissue with substrates such as oxygen and
glucose. Under normal conditions, cerebral blood flow is controlled by
autoregulation as well as metabolic, chemical and neurogenic regulation.
Physiological complexity of these mechanisms invariably leads to a question as
to what are the relations between the statistical properties of arterial and
intracranial pressure fluctuations. To shed new light on cerebral hemodynamics,
we employ a complex continuous wavelet transform to determine the instantaneous
phase difference between the arterial blood pressure (ABP) and intracranial
pressure (ICP) in patients with traumatic brain injuries or spontaneous
cerebral hemorrhage. For patients with mild to moderate injury, the phase
difference slowly evolves in time. However, severe neurological injury with
elevated ICP are herein associated with synchronization of arterial and
intracranial pressure. We use Shannon entropy to quantify the stability of
ABP-ICP phase difference and discuss the clinical applicability of such measure
to assessment of cerebrovascular reactivity and autoregulation integrity.
"
q-bio/0406045,2007-05-23,Complex Systems Analysis of Cell Cycling Models in Carcinogenesis,"  Carcinogenesis is a complex process that involves dynamically inter-connected
modular sub-networks that evolve under the influence of micro-environmentally
induced perturbations, in non-random, pseudo-Markov chain processes. An
appropriate n-stage model of carcinogenesis involves therefore n-valued Logic
treatments of nonlinear dynamic transformations of complex functional genomes
and cell interactomes. Lukasiewicz Algebraic Logic models of genetic networks
and signaling pathways in cells are formulated in terms of nonlinear dynamic
systems with n-state components that allow for the generalization of previous,
Boolean or ""fuzzy"", logic models of genetic activities in vivo. Such models are
then applied to cell transformations during carcinogenesis based on very
extensive genomic transcription and translation data from the CGAP databases
supported by NCI. Such models are represented in a Lukasiewicz-Topos with an
n-valued Lukasiewicz Algebraic Logics subobject classifier description that
represents non-random and nonlinear network activities as well as their
transformations in carcinogeness. Specific models for different types of cancer
are then derived from representations of the dynamic state-space of LT
non-random, pseudo-Markov chain process, network models in terms of cDNA and
proteomic, high throughput analyses by ultra-sensitive techniques. This novel
theoretical analysis is based on extensive CGAP genomic data for human tumors,
as well as recently published studies of cyclin signaling. Several such
specific models suggest novel clinical trials and rational therapies of cancer
through re-establishment of cell cycling inhibition in stage III cancers.

q-bio/0407001,2009-11-10,"Quantum Brain: A Recurrent Quantum Neural Network Model to Describe Eye
  Tracking of Moving Targets","  A theoretical quantum brain model is proposed using a nonlinear Schroedinger
wave equation. The model proposes that there exists a quantum process that
mediates the collective response of a neural lattice (classical brain). The
model is used to explain eye movements when tracking moving targets. Using a
Recurrent Quantum Neural Network(RQNN) while simulating the quantum brain
model, two very interesting phenomena are observed. First, as eye sensor data
is processed in a classical brain, a wave packet is triggered in the quantum
brain. This wave packet moves like a particle. Second, when the eye tracks a
fixed target, this wave packet moves not in a continuous but rather in a
discrete mode. This result reminds one of the saccadic movements of the eye
consisting of 'jumps' and 'rests'. However, such a saccadic movement is
intertwined with smooth pursuit movements when the eye has to track a dynamic
trajectory. In a sense, this is the first theoretical model explaining the
experimental observation reported concerning eye movements in a static scene
situation. The resulting prediction is found to be very precise and efficient
in comparison to classical objective modeling schemes such as the Kalman
filter.

infection. The memory function of the immune response can be set to work in
very different modes depending on the pattern followed during immunizations. It
is argued that the history and pattern of immunizations can be a decisive (and

population, including the effect of species which compete with the host. We
show that the existence of the second species has an important consequence for
the prevalence of the infectious agent in the host. When the two mice species
survive in the ecosystem, the competitive pressure of the second species may
lead to reduction or complete elimination of the prevalence of infection. The
transition between the disappearance of the infection and its presence occurs
at a critical value of the competitor's population, resembling a second order
phase transition in a statistical system. The results provide a rigorous
framework for the study of the impact of biodiversity in the propagation of
infectious diseases, and further lends itself to future experimental
verification.

  simulation studies of reentrant excitations using a detailed
  electrophysiological model","  In this numerical study, we investigate the role of intrinsic heterogeneities
of cardiac tissue due to M cells in the generation and maintenance of reentrant
excitations using the detailed Luo-Rudy dynamic model. This model has been
extended to include a description of the long QT 3 syndrome, and is studied in
both one dimension, corresponding to a cable traversing the ventricular wall,
and two dimensions, representing a transmural slice. We focus on two possible
mechanisms for the generation of reentrant events. We first investigate if
early-after-depolarizations occurring in M cells can initiate reentry. We find
that, even for large values of the long QT strength, the electrotonic coupling
between neighboring cells prevents early-after-depolarizations from creating a
reentry. We then study whether M cell domains, with their slow repolarization,
can function as wave blocks for premature stimuli. We find that the inclusion
of an M cell domain can result in some cases in reentrant excitations and we
determine the lifetime of the reentry as a function of the size and geometry of
the domain and of the strength of the long QT syndrome.

q-bio/0409015,2007-05-23,"Design Principle of Gene Expression Used by Human Stem Cells;
  Implication for Pluripotency","  Human embryonic stem cells (ESC) are undifferentiated and are endowed with
the capacities of self renewal and pluripotential differentiation. Adult stem
cells renew their own tissue, but whether they can trans-differentiate to other
tissues is still controversial. To understand the genetic program that
underlies the pluripotency of stem cells, we compared the transcription profile
of ESC with that of progenitor/stem cells of human hematopoietic and
keratinocytic origins, along with their mature cells to be viewed as snapshots
along tissue differentiation. ESC gene profile show higher complexity with
significantly more highly expressed genes than adult cells. We hypothesize that
ESC use a strategy of expressing genes that represent various differentiation
pathways and selection of only a few for continuous expression upon
differentiation to a particular target. Such a strategy may be necessary for
the pluripotency of ESC. The progenitors of either hematopoietic or
keratinocytic cells also follow the same design principle. Using advanced
clustering, we show that many of the ESC expressed genes are turned off in the
progenitors/stem cells followed by a further downregulation in adult tissues.
Concomitantly, genes specific to the target tissue are upregulated towards
matured cells of skin or blood.

consciousness, for its being in the present (the Now), its un-dividable unity,
its intrinsic subjectivity (autonomy). Finally, essential features of a

q-bio/0410001,2009-11-10,1/f Scaling in Heart Rate Requires Antagonistic Autonomic Control,"  We present the first systematic evidence for the origins of 1/f-type temporal
scaling in human heart rate. The heart rate is regulated by the activity of two
branches of the autonomic nervous system: the parasympathetic (PNS) and the
sympathetic (SNS) nervous systems. We examine alterations in the scaling
property when the balance between PNS and SNS activity is modified, and find
that the relative PNS suppression by congestive heart failure results in a
substantial increase in the Hurst exponent H towards random walk scaling
$1/f^{2}$ and a similar breakdown is observed with relative SNS suppression by
primary autonomic failure. These results suggest that 1/f scaling in heart rate
requires the intricate balance between the antagonistic activity of PNS and
SNS.

After the establishment of an appropriate protocol, the codified matrices were
individually presented to 150 university students who had to memorize them. A
computer simulation for a similar task is available which uses a perceptron on
which an algorithm was implemented allowing for some degree of globality
(technically referred to as entropic nonextensivity within a current

observation is that, for the very specific learning task on which we focus
here, humans perform similarly to slightly nonextensive perceptrons.
"
q-bio/0411012,2009-11-10,Graded and Binary Responses in Stochastic Gene Expression,"  Recently, several theoretical and experimental studies have been undertaken
to probe the effect of stochasticity on gene expression (GE). In experiments,
the GE response to an inducing signal in a cell, measured by the amount of
mRNAs/proteins synthesized, is found to be either graded or binary. The latter
type of response gives rise to a bimodal distribution in protein levels in an
ensemble of cells. One possible origin of binary response is cellular
bistability achieved through positive feedback or autoregulation. In this
paper, we study a simple, stochastic model of GE and show that the origin of
binary response lies exclusively in stochasticity. The transitions between the
active and inactive states of the gene are random in nature. Graded and binary
responses occur in the model depending on the relative stability of the
activated and deactivated gene states with respect to that of
mRNAs/proteins.The theoretical results on binary response provide a good
description of the ``all-or-none'' phenomenon observed in an eukaryotic system.
"
q-bio/0411013,2009-11-10,Noise Characteristics of Feed Forward Loops,"  A prominent feature of gene transcription regulatory networks is the presence
in large numbers of motifs, i.e, patterns of interconnection, in the networks.
One such motif is the feed forward loop (FFL) consisting of three genes X, Y
and Z. The protein product of x of X controls the synthesis of protein product
y of Y. Proteins x and y jointly regulate the synthesis of z proteins from the
gene Z. The FFLs, depending on the nature of the regulating interactions, can
be of eight different types which can again be classified into two categories:
coherent and incoherent. In this paper, we study the noise characteristics of
FFLs using the Langevin formalism and the Monte Carlo simulation technique
based on the Gillespie algorithm. We calculate the variances around the mean
protein levels in the steady states of the FFLs and find that, in the case of
coherent FFLs, the most abundant FFL, namely, the Type-1 coherent FFL, is the
least noisy. This is however not so in the case of incoherent FFLs. The results
suggest possible relationships between noise, functionality and abundance.

"
q-bio/0411039,2009-11-10,Emergence of Complex Dynamics in a Simple Model of Signaling Networks,"  A variety of physical, social and biological systems generate complex
fluctuations with correlations across multiple time scales. In physiologic
systems, these long-range correlations are altered with disease and aging. Such
correlated fluctuations in living systems have been attributed to the
interaction of multiple control systems; however, the mechanisms underlying
this behavior remain unknown. Here, we show that a number of distinct classes
of dynamical behaviors, including correlated fluctuations characterized by
$1/f$-scaling of their power spectra, can emerge in networks of simple
signaling units. We find that under general conditions, complex dynamics can be
generated by systems fulfilling two requirements: i) a ``small-world'' topology
and ii) the presence of noise. Our findings support two notable conclusions:
first, complex physiologic-like signals can be modeled with a minimal set of
components; and second, systems fulfilling conditions (i) and (ii) are robust
to some degree of degradation, i.e., they will still be able to generate
$1/f$-dynamics.

q-bio/0412014,2007-05-23,Robust formation of morphogen gradients,"  We discuss the formation of graded morphogen profiles in a cell layer by
nonlinear transport phenomena, important for patterning developing organisms.
We focus on a process termed transcytosis, where morphogen transport results
from binding of ligands to receptors on the cell surface, incorporation into
the cell and subsequent externalization. Starting from a microscopic model, we
derive effective transport equations. We show that, in contrast to morphogen
transport by extracellular diffusion, transcytosis leads to robust ligand
profiles which are insensitive to the rate of ligand production.
"
q-bio/0501001,2007-06-26,Elasticities and stabilities: lipid membranes vs cell membranes,"  A cell membrane can be simply regarded as composite material consisting of
lipid bilayer, membrane cytoskeleton beneath lipid bilayer, and proteins
embedded in lipid bilayer and linked with membrane cytoskeleton if one only
concerns its mechanical properties. In this Chapter, above all, the authors
give a brief introduction to some important work on mechanical properties of
lipid bilayers following Helfrich's seminal work on spontaneous curvature
energy of lipid bilayers. Next, the entropy of a polymer confined in a curved
surface and the free energy of membrane cytoskeleton are obtained by scaling
analysis. It is found that the free energy of cell membranes has the form of
the in-plane strain energy plus Helfrich's curvature energy. The equations to
describe equilibrium shapes and in-plane strains of cell membranes by osmotic
pressures are obtained by taking the first order variation of the total free
energy containing the elastic free energy, the surface tension energy and the
term induced by osmotic pressure. The stability of spherical cell membrane is
discussed and the critical pressure is found to be much larger than that of
spherical lipid bilayer without membrane cytoskeleton. Lastly, the authors try
to extend the present static mechanical model of cell membranes to the cell
structure dynamics by proposing a group of coupling equations involving
tensegrity architecture of cytoskeleton, fluid dynamics of cytoplasm and
elasticities of cell membranes.

q-bio/0501035,2007-05-23,Power-law scaling in dimension-to-biomass relationship of fish schools,"  Motivated by the finding that there is some biological universality in the
relationship between school geometry and school biomass of various pelagic
fishes in various conditions, I here establish a scaling law for school
dimensions: the school diameter increases as a power-law function of school
biomass. The power-law exponent is extracted through the data collapse, and is
close to 3/5. This value of the exponent implies that the mean packing density
decreases as the school biomass increases, and the packing structure displays a
mass-fractal dimension of 5/3. By exploiting an analogy between school geometry
and polymer chain statistics, I examine the behavioral algorithm governing the
swollen conformation of large-sized schools of pelagics, and I explain the
value of the exponent.

q-bio/0502002,2007-05-23,The Effects of EGF-Receptor Density on Multiscale Tumor Growth Patterns,"  We studied the effects of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) density on
tumor growth dynamics, both on the sub- and the multi-cellular level using our
previously developed model. This algorithm simulates the growth of a brain
tumor using a multi-scale two-dimensional agent-based approach with an
integrated transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha) induced
EGFR-gene-protein interaction network. The results confirm that increasing cell
receptor density correlates with an acceleration of the tumor system's
spatio-temporal expansion dynamics. This multicellular behavior cannot be
explained solely on the basis of spatial sub-cellular dynamics, which remain
qualitatively similar amongst the three glioma cell lines investigated here in
silico. Rather, we find that cells with higher EGFR density show an early
increase in the phenotypic switching activity between proliferative and
migratory traits, linked to a higher level of initial auto-stimulation by the
PLCgamma-mediated TGFalpha-EGFR autocrine network. This indicates a more active
protein level interaction in these chemotactically acting tumor systems and
supports the role of post-translational regulation for the implemented EGFR
pathway. Implications of these results for experimental cancer research are
discussed.

q-bio/0502008,2007-05-23,Dissociation in a polymerization model of homochirality,"  A fully self-contained model of homochirality is presented that contains the
effects of both polymerization and dissociation. The dissociation fragments are
assumed to replenish the substrate from which new monomers can grow and undergo
new polymerization. The mean length of isotactic polymers is found to grow
slowly with the normalized total number of corresponding building blocks.
Alternatively, if one assumes that the dissociation fragments themselves can
polymerize further, then this corresponds to a strong source of short polymers,
and an unrealistically short average length of only 3. By contrast, without
dissociation, isotactic polymers becomes infinitely long.

q-bio/0502025,2013-05-29,On the role of chemical synapses in coupled neurons with noise,"  We examine the behavior in the presence of noise of an array of Morris-Lecar
neurons coupled via chemical synapses. Special attention is devoted to
comparing this behavior with the better known case of electrical coupling
arising via gap junctions. In particular, our numerical simulations show that
chemical synapses are more efficient than gap junctions in enhancing coherence
at an optimal noise (what is known as array-enhanced coherence resonance): in
the case of (nonlinear) chemical coupling, we observe a substantial increase in
the stochastic coherence of the system, in comparison with (linear) electrical
coupling. We interpret this qualitative difference between both types of
coupling as arising from the fact that chemical synapses only act while the
presynaptic neuron is spiking, whereas gap junctions connect the voltage of the
two neurons at all times. This leads in the electrical coupling case to larger
correlations during interspike time intervals which are detrimental to the
array-enhanced coherence effect. Finally, we report on the existence of a
system-size coherence resonance in this locally coupled system, exhibited by
the average membrane potential of the array.

q-bio/0502036,2007-05-23,Morphogen Gradient from a Noisy Source,"  We investigate the effect of time-dependent noise on the shape of a morphogen
gradient in a developing embryo. Perturbation theory is used to calculate the
deviations from deterministic behavior in a simple reaction-diffusion model of
robust gradient formation, and the results are confirmed by numerical
simulation. It is shown that such deviations can disrupt robustness for
sufficiently high noise levels, and the implications of these findings for more
complex models of gradient-shaping pathways are discussed.

q-bio/0503002,2007-05-23,"SARS oubreaks in Ontario, Hong Kong and Singapore: the role of diagnosis
  and isolation as a control mechanism","  In this article we use global and regional data from the SARS epidemic in
conjunction with a model of susceptible, exposed, infective, diagnosed, and
recovered classes of people (``SEIJR'') to extract average properties and rate
constants for those populations. The model is fitted to data from the Ontario
(Toronto) in Canada, Hong Kong in China and Singapore outbreaks and predictions
are made based on various assumptions and observations, including the current
effect of isolating individuals diagnosed with SARS. The epidemic dynamics for
Hong Kong and Singapore appear to be different from the dynamics in Toronto,
Ontario. Toronto shows a very rapid increase in the number of cases between
March 31st and April 6th, followed by a {\it significant} slowing in the number
of new cases. We explain this as the result of an increase in the diagnostic
rate and in the effectiveness of patient isolation after March 26th. Our best
estimates are consistent with SARS eventually being contained in Toronto,
although the time of containment is sensitive to the parameters in our model.
It is shown that despite the empirically modeled heterogeneity in transmission,
SARS' average reproductive number is 1.2, a value quite similar to that
computed for some strains of influenza \cite{CC2}. Although it would not be
surprising to see levels of SARS infection higher than ten per cent in some
regions of the world (if unchecked), lack of data and the observed
heterogeneity and sensitivity of parameters prevent us from predicting the
long-term impact of SARS.

q-bio/0503006,2007-05-23,"The Basic Reproductive Number of Ebola and the Effects of Public Health
  Measures: The Cases of Congo and Uganda","  Despite improved control measures, Ebola remains a serious public health risk
in African regions where recurrent outbreaks have been observed since the
initial epidemic in 1976. Using epidemic modeling and data from two
well-documented Ebola outbreaks (Congo 1995 and Uganda 2000), we estimate the
number of secondary cases generated by an index case in the absence of control
interventions ($R_0$). Our estimate of $R_0$ is 1.83 (SD 0.06) for Congo (1995)
and 1.34 (SD 0.03) for Uganda (2000). We model the course of the outbreaks via
an SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) epidemic model that includes a
smooth transition in the transmission rate after control interventions are put
in place. We perform an uncertainty analysis of the basic reproductive number
$R_0$ to quantify its sensitivity to other disease-related parameters. We also
analyze the sensitivity of the final epidemic size to the time interventions
begin and provide a distribution for the final epidemic size. The control
measures implemented during these two outbreaks (including education and
contact tracing followed by quarantine) reduce the final epidemic size by a
factor of 2 relative the final size with a two-week delay in their
implementation.

  Application to the yeast proteome","  We propose a general method to predict functions of vertices where: 1. The
wiring of the network is somehow related to the vertex functionality. 2. A
fraction of the vertices are functionally classified. The method is influenced
by role-similarity measures of social network analysis. The two versions of our
prediction scheme is tested on model networks were the functions of the
vertices are designed to match their network surroundings. We also apply these
methods to the proteome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and find the
results compatible with more specialized methods.

  vitro} kidney cells","  This manuscript uses a statistical mechanical approach to study the effect of
the adhesion, through MOCA protein, on cell locomotion. The MOCA protein
regulates cell-cell adhesion, and we explore its potential role in the cell
movement. We present a series of statistical descriptions of the motion in
order to characterize the cell movement, and found that MOCA affects the
statistical scenario of cell locomotion. In particular, we observe that MOCA
enhances the tendency of joint motion, inhibits super-diffusion, and decreases
overall cell motion. These facts are compatible with the hypothesis that the
cells move faster in a less cohesive environment. Furthermore, we observe that
velocity distribution tails are longer than those predicted by
Maxwell-Boltzmann in all cases studied here, indicating that cell movement is
more complex than that of a liquid.

q-bio/0503020,2007-05-23,"Long-term evolution of an ecosystem with spontaneous periodicity of mass
  extinctions","  Twenty years ago, after analysing palaeontological data, Raup and Sepkoski
suggested that mass extinctions on Earth appear cyclically in time with a
period of approximately 26 million years (My). To explain the 26My period, a
number of proposals were made involving, e.g., astronomical effects, increased
volcanic activity, or the Earth's magnetic field reversal, none of which,
however, has been confirmed. Here we study a spatially extended discrete model
of an ecosystem and show that the periodicity of mass extinctions might be a
natural feature of the ecosystem's dynamics and not the result of a periodic
external perturbation. In our model, periodic changes of the diversity of an
ecosystem and some of its other characteristics are induced by the coevolution
of species. In agreement with some palaeontological data, our results show that
the longevity of a species depends on the evolutionary stage at which the
species is created. Possible further tests of our model are also discussed.

q-bio/0503027,2007-05-23,Nucleation and the transition state of the SH3 domain,"  We present a verified computational model of the SH3 domain transition state
(TS) ensemble. This model was built for three separate SH3 domains using
experimental s in all-atom protein folding simulations. While averaging over
all conformations incorrectly considers non-TS conformations as transition
states, quantifying structures as pre-TS, TS, and post-TS by measurement of
their transmission coefficient (pfold, or probability to fold) allows for
rigorous conclusions regarding the structure of the folding nucleus and a full
mechanistic analysis of the folding process. Through analysis of the TS, we
observe a highly polarized nucleus in which many residues are solvent-exposed.
Mechanistic analysis suggests the hydrophobic core forms largely after an early
nucleation step. SH3 presents an ideal system for studying the
nucleation-condensation mechanism and highlights the synergistic relationship
between experiment and simulation in the study of protein folding.

q-bio/0503036,2009-11-11,"On the Genealogy of Populations: Trees, Branches and Offsprings","  We consider a neutral haploid population whose generations are not
overlapping and whose size is large and constantly of $N$ individuals. Any
generation is replaced by a new one and any individual has a single parent. We
do not choose the stochastic rule which assigns the number of offsprings to any
individual since results do not depend on the details of the dynamics, and, as
a consequence, the model is parameter free. The genealogical tree is very
complex, and distances between individuals (number of generations from the
common ancestor) are distributed according to probability density which remains
random in the thermodynamic limit (large population). We give a theoretical and
numerical description of this distribution and we also consider the dynamical
aspects of the problem describing the time evolution of the maximum and mean
distances in a single population.
"
q-bio/0504009,2009-11-11,Dynamics of conduction blocks in a model of paced cardiac tissue,"  We study numerically the dynamics of conduction blocks using a detailed
electrophysiological model. We find that this dynamics depends critically on
the size of the paced region. Small pacing regions lead to stationary
conduction blocks while larger pacing regions can lead to conduction blocks
that travel periodically towards the pacing region. We show that this
size-dependence dynamics can lead to a novel arrhythmogenic mechanism.
Furthermore, we show that the essential phenomena can be captured in a much
simpler coupled-map model.

q-bio/0505006,2009-09-29,"Yeast Protein Interactome Topology Provides Framework for
  Coordinated-Functionality","  The architecture of the network of protein-protein physical interactions in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is exposed through the combination of two
complementary theoretical network measures, betweenness centrality and
`Q-modularity'. The yeast interactome is characterized by well-defined
topological modules connected via a small number of inter-module protein
interactions. Should such topological inter-module connections turn out to
constitute a form of functional coordination between the modules, we speculate
that this coordination is occurring typically in a pair-wise fashion, rather
than by way of high-degree hub proteins responsible for coordinating multiple
modules. The unique non-hub-centric hierarchical organization of the
interactome is not reproduced by gene duplication-and-divergence stochastic
growth models that disregard global selective pressures.

q-bio/0505020,2007-11-06,The contact network of patients in a regional healthcare system,"  Yet in spite of advances in hospital treatment, hospitals continue to be a
breeding ground for several airborne diseases and for diseases that are
transmitted through close contacts like SARS, methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), norovirus infections and tuberculosis (TB). Here
we extract contact networks for up to 295,108 inpatients for durations up to
two years from a database used for administrating a local public healthcare
system serving a population of 1.9 million individuals. Structural and
dynamical properties of the network of importance for the transmission of
contagious diseases are then analyzed by methods from network epidemiology. The
contact networks are found to be very much determined by an extreme (age
independent) variation in duration of hospital stays and the hospital
structure. We find that that the structure of contacts between in-patients
exhibit structural properties, such as a high level of transitivity,
assortativity and variation in number of contacts, that are likely to be of
importance for the transmission of less contagious diseases. If these
properties are considered when designing prevention programs the risk for and
the effect of epidemic outbreaks may be decreased.

q-bio/0505022,2009-11-11,Modelization of Thermal Fluctuations in G Protein-Coupled Receptors,"  We simulate the electrical properties of a device realized by a G protein
coupled receptor (GPCR), embedded in its membrane and in contact with two
metallic electrodes through which an external voltage is applied. To this
purpose, recently, we have proposed a model based on a coarse graining
description, which describes the protein as a network of elementary impedances.
The network is built from the knowledge of the positions of the C-alpha atoms
of the amino acids, which represent the nodes of the network. Since the
elementary impedances are taken depending of the inter-nodes distance, the
conformational change of the receptor induced by the capture of the ligand
results in a variation of the network impedance. On the other hand, the
fluctuations of the atomic positions due to thermal motion imply an impedance
noise, whose level is crucial to the purpose of an electrical detection of the
ligand capture by the GPCR. Here, in particular, we address this issue by
presenting a computational study of the impedance noise due to thermal
fluctuations of the atomic positions within a rhodopsin molecule. In our model,
the C-alpha atoms are treated as independent, isotropic, harmonic oscillators,
with amplitude depending on the temperature and on the position within the
protein (alpha-helix or loop). The relative fluctuation of the impedance is
then calculated for different temperatures.

q-bio/0505028,2007-05-23,Discretization of Time Series Data,"  Data discretization, also known as binning, is a frequently used technique in
computer science, statistics, and their applications to biological data
analysis. We present a new method for the discretization of real-valued data
into a finite number of discrete values. Novel aspects of the method are the
incorporation of an information-theoretic criterion and a criterion to
determine the optimal number of values. While the method can be used for data
clustering, the motivation for its development is the need for a discretization
algorithm for several multivariate time series of heterogeneous data, such as
transcript, protein, and metabolite concentration measurements. As several
modeling methods for biochemical networks employ discrete variable states, the
method needs to preserve correlations between variables as well as the dynamic
features of the time series. A C++ implementation of the algorithm is available
from the authors at http://polymath.vbi.vt.edu/discretization .

q-bio/0505035,2009-11-11,A minimal stochastic model for influenza evolution,"  We introduce and discuss a minimal individual-based model for influenza
dynamics. The model takes into account the effects of specific immunization
against viral strains, but also infectivity randomness and the presence of a
short-lived strain transcending immunity recently suggested in the literature.
We show by simulations that the resulting model exhibits substitution of viral
strains along the years, but that their divergence remains bounded. We also
show that dropping any of these features results in a drastically different
behavior, leading either to the extinction of the disease, to the proliferation
of the viral strains, or to their divergence.
"
q-bio/0505036,2007-05-23,"Hydromechanical considerations on the evolution and diversification of
  the echinoderm bauplans","  The pentaradial organisation of echinoderms is postulated to have evolved as
the result of the reorganisation of the internal U-shaped mesentery of the
intestinal tract during inflation of the trunk of a pterobranch-like ancestor.
Under this scenario, loops of the mesentery developed between five hydraulic
bulges by three different mechanisms: (1) by the early formation of two
additional loops resulting directly in five hydraulic bulges, (2) by the
subsequent formation of two additional loops resulting in the formation of
initially three and then five hydraulic bulges or (3) by the inflation of the
body without formation of loops. Accordingly there are at least three main
evolutionary pathways within the echinoderms. The anatomical structures, such
as the ambulacral system or the skeletal capsule, which characterize the
echinoderms, developed independently in both lineages. From all the three
pathways various body structures can be derived matching those found in fossil
and extant echinoderms. The eleutherozoans and the earliest pentaradial
echinoderms most likely evolved from the direct-pentaradial pathway whereas
triradiate echinoderms and those which show a pentaradial organisation
superimposed on triradial symmetry, likely evolved along the indirect pathway.
The asymmetric or bilateral symmetric echinoderms evolved from the third
paythway. The most important morphological transformations leading to the
directly and indirectly pentaradial echinoderms are discussed and described.
"
q-bio/0505038,2007-05-23,"Hydromechanical considerations on the origin of the pentaradial body
  structure of echinoderms","  When echinoderms are conceptualized as hydraulic entities, the early
evolution of this group can be presented in a scenario which describes how a
bilateral ancestor (an enteropneust-like organism) gradually evolved into a
pentaradial echinoderm. According to this scenario, the arms are outgrowths
from the anterior/posterior body axis of the bilateral pterobranchia-like
intermediate. These outgrowths developed when the originally U-shaped mesentery
of the intestinal tract formed loops, and correspondingly, the tensile chords
of the mesentery were attached to the body wall in five loops. The wall faces
between these regions of tensile chords could bulge out under the hydraulic
pressure of the body coelom. The originally more or less round body cavity was
deformed into a pneu with five bulges. The loops of the gut forced a roughly
symmetric arrangement, which was enhanced by a physical fact: five pneus as
well as one pneu with five internal tethers, naturally adopt a pentaradial
pattern of ""minimum contact surfaces"", as the most economic arrangement. These
evolutionary transformations were accompanied by certain histological
modifications, such as the development of mutable connective tissues and
skeletal elements that fused to ossicles and provided shape stabilization in
the form of a calcareous skeleton in the tissues of the body wall. The
resultant organism was an ancestral eleutherozoan echinoderm (Ur-Echinoderm).

q-bio/0505044,2016-09-08,"The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of a highly contagious
  disease in Sweden","  Travel restrictions may reduce the spread of a contagious disease that
threatens public health. In this study we investigate what effect different
levels of travel restrictions may have on the speed and geographical spread of
an outbreak of a disease similar to SARS. We use a stochastic simulation model
of the Swedish population, calibrated with survey data of travel patterns
between municipalities in Sweden collected over three years. We find that a ban
on journeys longer than 50 km drastically reduces the speed and the
geographical spread of outbreaks, even with when compliance is less than 100%.
The result is found to be robust for different rates of inter-municipality
transmission intensities. Travel restrictions may therefore be an effective way
to mitigate the effect of a future outbreak.

  analysis","  A model of the dynamics of natural rotifer populations is described as a
discrete nonlinear map depending on three parameters, which reflect
characteristics of the population and environment. Model dynamics and their
change by variation of these parameters were investigated by methods of
bifurcation theory. A phase-parametric portrait of the model was constructed
and domains of population persistence (stable equilibrium, periodic and
a-periodic oscillations of population size) as well as population extinction
were identified and investigated. The criteria for population persistence and
approaches to determining critical parameter values are described. The results
identify parameter values that lead to population extinction under various
environmental conditions. They further illustrate that the likelihood of
extinction can be substantially increased by small changes in environmental
quality, which shifts populations into new dynamical regimes.

describe MinD/MinE dynamical structures in Escherichia coli. This model
spontaneously generates pole-to-pole oscillations of the membrane-associated
MinD proteins, MinE ring, as well as filaments of the membrane-associated MinD
proteins. Experimental data suggest MinD filaments are two-stranded. In order
to model them we assume that each membrane-associated MinD protein can form up
to three bonds with adjacent membrane associated MinD molecules and that MinE
induced hydrolysis strongly depends on the number of bonds MinD has
established.

the the labels of a vector state of an irreducible representation of U_q(sl(2))
(U_q(sl(2) + sl(2))), in the limit q -> 0. A master equation for the
distribution function is written, where the intensity of the one-spin flip is
assumed to depend from the variation of the labels of the state. In the two
letters approximation, the numerically computed equilibrium distribution for
short sequences is nicely fitted by a Yule distribution, which is the observed
distribution of the ranked short oligonucleotides frequency in DNA. The four
letter alphabet description, applied to the codons, is able to reproduce the
form of the fitted rank ordered usage frequencies distribution.
"
q-bio/0506013,2007-05-23,Statistical model selection methods applied to biological networks,"  Many biological networks have been labelled scale-free as their degree
distribution can be approximately described by a powerlaw distribution. While
the degree distribution does not summarize all aspects of a network it has
often been suggested that its functional form contains important clues as to
underlying evolutionary processes that have shaped the network. Generally
determining the appropriate functional form for the degree distribution has
been fitted in an ad-hoc fashion.
  Here we apply formal statistical model selection methods to determine which
functional form best describes degree distributions of protein interaction and
metabolic networks. We interpret the degree distribution as belonging to a
class of probability models and determine which of these models provides the
best description for the empirical data using maximum likelihood inference,
composite likelihood methods, the Akaike information criterion and
goodness-of-fit tests. The whole data is used in order to determine the
parameter that best explains the data under a given model (e.g. scale-free or
random graph). As we will show, present protein interaction and metabolic
network data from different organisms suggests that simple scale-free models do
not provide an adequate description of real network data.

q-bio/0506042,2007-05-23,"Towards a Quantitative, Metabolic Theory for Mammalian Sleep","  Sleep is one of the most noticeable and widespread phenomena occurring in
multicellular animals. Nevertheless, no consensus for a theory of its origins
has emerged. In particular, no explicit, quantitative theory exists that
elucidates or distinguishes between the myriad hypotheses proposed for sleep.
Here, we develop a general, quantitative theory for mammalian sleep that
relates many of its fundamental parameters to metabolic rate and body size.
Most mechanisms suggested for the function of sleep can be placed in this
framework, e.g., cellular repair of damage caused by metabolic processes and
cortical reorganization to process sensory input. Our theory leads to
predictions for sleep time, sleep cycle time, and REM (rapid-eye-movement) time
as functions of body and brain mass, and explains, for example, why mice sleep
\~14 hours per day relative to the 3.5 hours per day that elephants sleep. Data
for 96 species of mammals, spanning six orders of magnitude in body size, are
consistent with these predictions and provide strong evidence that time scales
for sleep are set by the brain's, not the whole-body, metabolic rate.

q-bio/0507014,2007-05-23,Nonlinear brain dynamics and many-body field dynamics,"  We report measurements of the brain activity of subjects engaged in
behavioral exchanges with their environments. We observe brain states which are
characterized by coordinated oscillation of populations of neurons that are
changing rapidly with the evolution of the meaningful relationship between the
subject and its environment, established and maintained by active perception.
Sequential spatial patterns of neural activity with high information content
found in sensory cortices of trained animals between onsets of conditioned
stimuli and conditioned responses resemble cinematographic frames. They are not
readily amenable to description either with classical integrodifferential
equations or with the matrix algebras of neural networks. Their modeling is
provided by field theory from condensed matter physics.

q-bio/0507028,2007-05-23,"Dynamics of Heterogeneous Populations and Communities and Evolution of

identical, that is, the fundamental role of variation is ignored. Inhomogeneous
models of populations and communities allow for birth and death rates to vary
among individuals; recently, theorems of existence and asymptotic of solutions
of such models were investigated. Here we develop another approach to modeling
heterogeneous populations by reducing the model to the Cauchy problem for a
special system of ODEs. As a result, the total population size and current
distribution of the vector-parameter can be found in explicit analytical form
or computed effectively. The developed approach is extended to the models of

q-bio/0507029,2007-05-23,"Prediction and predictability of global epidemics: the role of the
  airline transportation network","  The systematic study of large-scale networks has unveiled the ubiquitous
presence of connectivity patterns characterized by large scale heterogeneities
and unbounded statistical fluctuations. These features affect dramatically the
behavior of the diffusion processes occurring on networks, determining the
ensuing statistical properties of their evolution pattern and dynamics. In this
paper, we investigate the role of the large scale properties of the airline
transportation network in determining the global evolution of emerging disease.
We present a stochastic computational framework for the forecast of global
epidemics that considers the complete world-wide air travel infrastructure
complemented with census population data. We address two basic issues in global
epidemic modeling: i) We study the role of the large scale properties of the
airline transportation network in determining the global diffusion pattern of
emerging diseases; ii) We evaluate the reliability of forecasts and outbreak
scenarios with respect to the intrinsic stochasticity of disease transmission
and traffic flows. In order to address these issues we define a set of novel
quantitative measures able to characterize the level of heterogeneity and
predictability of the epidemic pattern. These measures may be used for the
analysis of containment policies and epidemic risk assessment.

q-bio/0507044,2009-11-11,A core genetic module : the Mixed Feedback Loop,"  The so-called Mixed Feedback Loop (MFL) is a small two-gene network where
protein A regulates the transcription of protein B and the two proteins form a
heterodimer. It has been found to be statistically over-represented in
statistical analyses of gene and protein interaction databases and to lie at
the core of several computer-generated genetic networks. Here, we propose and
mathematically study a model of the MFL and show that, by itself, it can serve
both as a bistable switch and as a clock (an oscillator) depending on kinetic
parameters. The MFL phase diagram as well as a detailed description of the
nonlinear oscillation regime are presented and some biological examples are
discussed. The results emphasize the role of protein interactions in the
function of genetic modules and the usefulness of modelling RNA dynamics
explicitly.

  are uniformly expressed","  We explore the interplay between the protein-protein interactions network and
the expression of the interacting proteins. It is shown that interacting
proteins are expressed in significantly more similar cellular concentrations.
This is largely due to interacting pairs which are part of protein complexes.
We solve a generic model of complex formation and show explicitly that
complexes form most efficiently when their members have roughly the same
concentrations. Therefore, the observed similarity in interacting protein
concentrations could be attributed to optimization for efficiency of complex
formation.

q-bio/0508024,2007-05-23,Reading Sequences of Interspike Intervals in Biological Neural Circuits,"  Sensory systems pass information about an animal's environment to higher
nervous system units through sequences of action potentials. When these action
potentials have essentially equivalent waveforms, all information is contained
in the interspike intervals (ISIs) of the spike sequence. We address the
question: How do neural circuits recognize and read these ISI sequences?
  Our answer is given in terms of a biologically inspired neural circuit that
we construct using biologically realistic neurons. The essential ingredients of
the ISI Reading Unit (IRU) are (i) a tunable time delay circuit modelled after
one found in the anterior forebrain pathway of the birdsong system and (ii) a
recently observed rule for inhibitory synaptic plasticity. We present a circuit
that can both learn the ISIs of a training sequence using inhibitory synaptic
plasticity and then recognize the same ISI sequence when it is presented on
subsequent occasions. We investigate the ability of this IRU to learn in the
presence of two kinds of noise: jitter in the time of each spike and random
spikes occurring in the ideal spike sequence. We also discuss how the circuit
can be detuned by removing the selected ISI sequence and replacing it by an ISI
sequence with ISIs drawn from a probability distribution.
  We have investigated realizations of the time delay circuit using
Hodgkin-Huxley conductance based neurons connected by realistic excitatory and
inhibitory synapses. Our models for the time delay circuit are tunable from
about 10 ms to 100 ms allowing one to learn and recognize ISI sequences within
that range of ISIs. ISIs down to a few ms and longer than 100 ms are possible
with other intrinsic and synaptic currents in the component neurons.

q-bio/0509017,2009-11-11,Spiky oscillations in NF-kB signalling,"  The NF-kB signalling system is involved in a variety of cellular processes
including immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. Recent experiments have
found oscillations in the nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of the NF-kB
transcription factor. How the cell uses the oscillations to differentiate input
conditions and send specific signals to downstream genes is an open problem. We
shed light on this issue by examining the small core network driving the
oscillations, which, we show, is designed to produce periodic spikes in nuclear
NF-kB concentration. The oscillations can be used to regulate downstream genes
in a variety of ways. In particular, we show that genes to whose operator sites
NF-kB binds and dissociates fast can respond very sensitively to changes in the
input signal, with effective Hill coefficients in excess of 20.

q-bio/0509022,2011-07-29,"A Cognitive Model of an Epistemic Community: Mapping the Dynamics of
  Shallow Lake Ecosystems","  We used fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) to develop a generic shallow lake
ecosystem model by augmenting the individual cognitive maps drawn by 8
scientists working in the area of shallow lake ecology. We calculated graph
theoretical indices of the individual cognitive maps and the collective
cognitive map produced by augmentation. The graph theoretical indices revealed
internal cycles showing non-linear dynamics in the shallow lake ecosystem. The
ecological processes were organized democratically without a top-down
hierarchical structure. The steady state condition of the generic model was a
characteristic turbid shallow lake ecosystem since there were no dynamic
environmental changes that could cause shifts between a turbid and a clearwater
state, and the generic model indicated that only a dynamic disturbance regime
could maintain the clearwater state. The model developed herein captured the
empirical behavior of shallow lakes, and contained the basic model of the
Alternative Stable States Theory. In addition, our model expanded the basic
model by quantifying the relative effects of connections and by extending it.
In our expanded model we ran 4 simulations: harvesting submerged plants,
nutrient reduction, fish removal without nutrient reduction, and
biomanipulation. Only biomanipulation, which included fish removal and nutrient
reduction, had the potential to shift the turbid state into clearwater state.
The structure and relationships in the generic model as well as the outcomes of
the management simulations were supported by actual field studies in shallow
lake ecosystems. Thus, fuzzy cognitive mapping methodology enabled us to
understand the complex structure of shallow lake ecosystems as a whole and
obtain a valid generic model based on tacit knowledge of experts in the field.

q-bio/0510008,2016-09-08,"The Tangled nature model with inheritance and constraint: Evolutionary
  ecology restricted by a conserved resource","  We study a version of the Tangled Nature model of evolutionary ecology
redefined in a phenotype space where mutants have properties correlated to
their parents. The model has individual-based dynamics whilst incorporating
species scale competitive constraints and a system scale resource constraint.
Multiple species arise that coexist in a species interaction network with
evolving global properties. Both the mean interaction strength and the network
connectance increase relative to the null system as mutualism becomes more
extensive. From a study of the dependence of average degree on the resource
level we extract the diversity-connectance relationship which conforms to the
hyperbolic form seen in field data. This is adjudged to arise as a consequence
of the evolutionary pressure to achieve positive interactions. The network
degree distributions conform more strongly to exponential than to the null
binomial distributions in all cases. This effect is believed to be caused by
correlations in the reproductive process. We also study how resource
availability influences the phenotypical lifetime distribution which is
approximately of power law form. We observe that the mean lifetime is inversely
related to the resource level.

q-bio/0510012,2009-11-11,Gene Copy Number and Cell Cycle Arrest,"  The cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events which ultimately lead to the
division of a single cell into two daughter cells. In the case of DNA damage by
radiation or chemicals, the damage checkpoints in the $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$
phases of the cell cycle are activated. This results in an arrest of the cell
cycle so that the DNA damage can be repaired. Once this is done, the cell
continues with its usual cycle of activity. We study a mathematical model of
the DNA damage checkpoint in the $G_{2}$ phase which arrests the transition
from the $G_{2}$ to the $M$ (mitotic) phase of the cell cycle. The tumor
suppressor protein p53 plays a key role in activating the pathways leading to
cell cycle arrest in mammalian systems. If the DNA damage is severe, the p53
proteins activate other pathways which bring about apoptosis, i.e., programmed
cell death. Loss of the p53 gene results in the proliferation of cells
containing damaged DNA, i.e., in the growth of tumors which may ultimately
become cancerous. There is some recent experimental evidence which suggests
that the mutation of a single copy of the p53 gene (in the normal cell each
gene has two identical copies) is sufficient to trigger the formation of
tumors. We study the effect of reducing the gene copy number of the p53 and two
other genes on cell cycle arrest and obtain results consistent with
experimental observations.

q-bio/0511001,2007-05-23,Impact of Climate Change on Forests in India,"  Global assessments have shown that future climate change is likely to
significantly impact forest ecosystems. The present study makes an assessment
of the impact of projected climate change on forest ecosystems in India. This
assessment is based on climate projections of Regional Climate Model of the
Hadley Centre (HadRM3) using the A2 (740 ppm CO2) and B2 (575 ppm CO2)
scenarios of Special Report on Emissions Scenarios and the BIOME4 vegetation
response model. The main conclusion is that under the climate projection for
the year 2085, 77% and 68% of the forested grids in India are likely to
experience shift in forest types under A2 and B2 scenario, respectively.
Indications are a shift towards wetter forest types in the northeastern region
and drier forest types in the northwestern region in the absence of human
influence. Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate warming could
also result in a doubling of net primary productivity under the A2 scenario and
nearly 70% increase under the B2 scenario. The trends of impacts could be
considered as robust but the magnitudes should be viewed with caution, due to
the uncertainty in climate projections. Given the projected trends of likely
impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems, it is important to incorporate
climate change consideration in forest sector long-term planning process.

  interdisciplinary theory of change of state","  It is increasingly evident that there is more to biological evolution than
natural selection; moreover, the concept of evolution is not limited to
biology. We propose an integrative framework for characterizing how entities
evolve, in which evolution is viewed as a process of context-driven
actualization of potential (CAP). Processes of change differ according to the
degree of nondeterminism, and the degree to which they are sensitive to,
internalize, and depend upon a particular context. The approach enables us to
embed phenomena across disciplines into a broad conceptual framework. We give
examples of insights into physics, biology, culture and cognition that derive
from this unifying framework.

developing biological system. We assume the existence of two morphogen
gradients, an activator emanating from the anterior, and a co-repressor from
the posterior. The co-repressor inhibits the action of the activator in
switching on target genes. We apply this system to Drosophila embryos, where we
predict the existence of a hitherto undetected posterior co-repressor. Using
mathematical modelling, we show that a symmetric activator-co-repressor model
can quantitatively explain the precise mid-embryo expression boundary of the
hunchback gene, and the scaling of this pattern with embryo size.

  with ALL-1 rearrangements","  The ALL-1 gene is directly involved in 5-10% of ALLs and AMLs by fusion to
other genes or through internal rearrangements. DNA microarrays were utilized
to determine expression profiles of ALLs and AMLs with ALL-1 rearrangements.
These profiles distinguish those tumors from other ALLs and AMLs. The
expression patterns of ALL-1-associated tumors, in particular ALLs, involve
oncogenes, tumor suppressors, anti apoptotic genes, drug resistance genes etc.,
and correlate with the aggressive nature of the tumors. The genes whose
expression differentiates between ALLs with and without ALL-1 rearrangement
were further divided into several groups enabling separation of ALL-1-
associated ALLs into two subclasses. Further, AMLs with partial duplication of
ALL-1 vary in their expression pattern from AMLs in which ALL-1 had undergone
fusion to other genes. The extensive analysis described here draws attention to
genes which might have a direct role in pathogenesis.

  in Panama","  Simple random walk considerations are used to interpret rodent population
data collected in Hantavirus-related investigations in Panama regarding the
short-tailed cane mouse, \emph{Zygodontomys brevicauda}. The diffusion constant
of mice is evaluated to be of the order of (and larger than) 200 meters squared
per day. The investigation also shows that the rodent mean square displacement
saturates in time, indicating the existence of a spatial scale which could, in
principle, be the home range of the rodents. This home range is concluded to be
of the order of 70 meters. Theoretical analysis is provided for interpreting
animal movement data in terms of an interplay of the home ranges, the diffusion
constant, and the size of the grid used to monitor the movement. The study
gives impetus to a substantial modification of existing theory of the spread of
the Hantavirus epidemic which has been based on simple diffusive motion of the
rodents, and additionally emphasizes the importance for developing more
accurate techniques for the measurement of rodent movement.

  Animal Populations","  A theory is provided for the estimation of home ranges of animals from the
standard mark-recapture technique in which data are collected by capturing,
tagging and recapturing the animals. The theoretical tool used is the
Fokker-Planck equation, its characteristic quantities being the diffusion
constant which describes the motion of the animals, and the attractive
potential which addresses their tendency to live near their burrows. The
measurement technique is shown to correspond to the calculation of a certain
kind of mean square displacement of the animals relevant to the specific
probing window in space corresponding to the trapping region. The output of the
theory is a sigmoid curve of the observable mean square displacement as a
function of the ratio of distances characteristic of the home range and the
trapping region, along with an explicit prescription to extract the home range
form observations. Applications of the theory to rodent movement in Panama and
New Mexico are pointed out. An analysis is given of the sensitivity of our
theory to the choice of the confining potential via the use of various
representative cases. A comparison is provided between home range size inferred
from our method and from other procedures employed in the literature.
Consequences of home range overlap are also discussed.

  many-body field dynamics","  Neural activity patterns related to behavior occur at many scales in time and
space from the atomic and molecular to the whole brain. Here we explore the
feasibility of interpreting neurophysiological data in the context of many-body
physics by using tools that physicists have devised to analyze comparable
hierarchies in other fields of science. We focus on a mesoscopic level that
offers a multi-step pathway between the microscopic functions of neurons and
the macroscopic functions of brain systems revealed by hemodynamic imaging. We
use electroencephalographic (EEG) records collected from high-density electrode
arrays fixed on the epidural surfaces of primary sensory and limbic areas in
rabbits and cats trained to discriminate conditioned stimuli (CS) in the
various modalities. High temporal resolution of EEG signals with the Hilbert
transform gives evidence for diverse intermittent spatial patterns of amplitude
(AM) and phase modulations (PM) of carrier waves that repeatedly re-synchronize
in the beta and gamma ranges at near zero time lags over long distances. The
dominant mechanism for neural interactions by axodendritic synaptic
transmission should impose distance-dependent delays on the EEG oscillations
owing to finite propagation velocities. It does not. EEGs instead show evidence
for anomalous dispersion: the existence in neural populations of a low velocity
range of information and energy transfers, and a high velocity range of the
spread of phase transitions. This distinction labels the phenomenon but does
not explain it. In this report we explore the analysis of these phenomena using
concepts of energy dissipation, the maintenance by cortex of multiple ground
states corresponding to AM patterns, and the exclusive selection by spontaneous
breakdown of symmetry (SBS) of single states in sequences.

is now a key issue in biology. Comparison of regulatory networks performing
similar tasks can give insights into how network architecture is constrained by
the functions it directs. We here discuss methods of network comparison based
on network architecture and signaling logic. Introducing local and global
signaling scores for the difference between two networks we quantify
similarities between evolutionary closely and distantly related bacteriophages.
Despite the large evolutionary separation between phage $\lambda$ and 186 their

protein similarities viewed from the network perspective.
"
q-bio/0512003,2010-07-13,Optimal strategies for fighting persistent bugs,"  Some microbial organisms are known to randomly slip into and out of
hibernation, irrespective of environmental conditions [1]. In a (genetically)
uniform population a typically very small subpopulation becomes metabolically
inactive whereas the majority subpopulation remains active and grows. Bacteria
such as E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA-superbug), Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [1-3] show persistence. It can render
bacteria less vulnerable in adverse environments [1, 4, 5] and their effective
eradication through medication more difficult [2, 3, 6]. Here we show that
medication treatment regimes may have to be modified when persistence is taken
into account and characterize optimal approaches assuming that the total
medication dose is constrained. The determining factors are cumulative
toxicity, eradication power of the medication and bacterial response
timescales. Persistent organisms have to be fought using tailored eradication
strategies which display two fundamental characteristics. Ideally, the
treatment time should be significantly longer than in the case of persistence
with the medication uniformly spread out over time; however, if treatment time
has to be limited, then the application of medication has to be concentrated
towards the beginning and end of the treatment. These findings deviate from
current clinical practice, and may therefore help to optimize and simplify
treatments. Our use of multi-objective optimization [7] to map out the optimal
strategies can be generalized to other related problems.

q-bio/0512007,2007-05-23,"Efficiency, Robustness and Stochasticity of Gene Regulatory Networks in
  Systems Biology: lambda Switch as a Working Example","  Phage lambda is one of the most studied biological models in modern molecular
biology. Over the past 50 years quantitative experimental knowledge on this
biological model has been accumulated at all levels: physics, chemistry,
genomics, proteomics, functions, and more. All its components have been known
to a great detail. The theoretical task has been to integrate its components to
make the organism working quantitatively in a harmonic manner. This would test
our biological understanding and would lay a solid fundamental for further
explorations and applications, an obvious goal of systems biology. One of the
outstanding challenges in doing so has been the so-called stability puzzle of
lambda switch: the biologically observed robustness and its difficult
mathematical reconstruction based on known experimental values. In this chapter
we review the recent theoretical and experimental efforts on tackling this
problem. An emphasis is put on the minimum quantitative modeling where a
successful numerical agreement between experiments and modeling has been
achieved. A novel method tentatively named stochastic dynamical structure
analysis emerged from such study is also discussed within a broad modeling
perspective.
"
q-bio/0512016,2007-05-23,Modeling stochastic gene expression under repression,"  Intrinsic transcriptional noise induced by operator fluctuations is
investigated with a simple spin like stochastic model. The effects of
transcriptional fluctuations in protein synthesis is probed by coupling
transcription and translation by an amplificative interaction. In the presence
of repression a new term contributes to the noise which depends on the rate of
mRNA production. If the switching time is small compared with the mRNA life
time the noise is also small. In general the dumping of protein production by a
repressive agent occurs linearly but the fluctuations can show a maxima at
intermediate repression. The discrepancy between the switching time, the mRNA
degradation and protein degradation is crucial for the repressive control in
translation without large fluctuations. The noise profiles obtained here are in
quantitative agreement with recent experiments.

q-bio/0512031,2007-05-23,"Egocentric Path Integration Models and their Application to Desert
  Arthropods","  Path integration enables desert arthropods to find back to their nest on the
shortest track from any position. To perform path integration successfully,
speeds and turning angles along the preceding outbound path have to be measured
continuously and combined to determine an internal {\em global vector} leading
back home at any time. A number of experiments have given an idea how
arthropods might use allothetic or idiothetic signals to perceive their
orientation and moving speed. We systematically review the four possible model
descriptions of mathematically precise path integration, whereby we favour and
elaborate the hitherto not used variant of egocentric cartesian coordinates.
Its simple and intuitive structure is demonstrated in comparison to the other
models. Measuring two speeds, the forward moving speed and the angular turning
rate, and implementing them into a linear system of differential equations
provides the necessary information during outbound route, reorientation process
and return path. In addition, we propose several possible types of systematic
errors that can cause deviations from the correct homeward course. Deviations
have been observed for several species of desert arthropods in different
experiments, but their origin is still under debate. Using our egocentric path
integration model we propose simple error indices depending on path geometry
that will allow future experiments to rule out or corroborate certain error
types.

  strains in Botswana","  Background: Approximately 40% of adults in Botswana are HIV-infected. The
Botswana antiretroviral program began in 2002 and currently treats 34,000
patients with a goal of treating 85,000 patients (~30% of HIV-infected adults)
by 2009. We predict the evolution of drug-resistant strains of HIV that may
emerge as a consequence of this treatment program. We discuss the implications
of our results for the World Health Organization's (WHO's) proposed
surveillance system for detecting drug-resistant strains of HIV in Africa.
Methods: We use a mathematical model of the emergence of drug resistance. We
incorporate demographic and treatment data to make specific predictions as to
when the WHO surveillance threshold is likely to be exceeded. Results: Our
results show - even if rates of acquired resistance are high, but the
drug-resistant strains that evolve are only half as transmissible as wild-type
strains - that transmission of drug-resistant strains will remain low (< 5% by
2009) and are unlikely to exceed the WHO's surveillance threshold. However,our
results show that transmission of drug-resistant strains in Botswana could
increase to ~15% by 2009 if resistant strains are as transmissible as wild-type
strains. Conclusion: The WHO's surveillance system is designed to detect
transmitted resistance that exceeds a threshold level of 5%. Whether this
system will detect drug-resistant strains in Botswana by 2009 will depend upon
the transmissibility of the strains that emerge. Our results imply that it
could be many years before the WHO detects transmitted resistance in other
sub-Saharan African countries with less ambitious treatment programs than
Botswana.

q-bio/0512040,2007-05-23,Ambiguous model learning made unambiguous with 1/f priors,"  What happens to the optimal interpretation of noisy data when there exists
more than one equally plausible interpretation of the data? In a Bayesian
model-learning framework the answer depends on the prior expectations of the
dynamics of the model parameter that is to be inferred from the data. Local
time constraints on the priors are insufficient to pick one interpretation over
another. On the other hand, nonlocal time constraints, induced by a $1/f$ noise
spectrum of the priors, is shown to permit learning of a specific model
parameter even when there are infinitely many equally plausible interpretations
of the data. This transition is inferred by a remarkable mapping of the model
estimation problem to a dissipative physical system, allowing the use of
powerful statistical mechanical methods to uncover the transition from
indeterminate to determinate model learning.

conspecifics can raise their tail, which is very similar to a morphine-induced
Straub tail response. Since this response is a typical index of opiate
activation, it has been proposed that the opioidergic systems of such mice are
chronically activated. This activation appeared to be a potent factor, which
leads to addiction to aggression. To check this hypothesis, we exposed the mice
who had won 20 fights in succession with conspecifics to a behavioral
sensitization procedure. The effects of the mu-opioid receptor agonist morphine
(10 mg/kg, i.p.) on the behavior of winners were examined in an open-field test
before and after 5- and 14-day deprivation of aggression. Morphine had a much
stronger stimulating effect on the open-field behavior of 60 % of the winners
deprived of aggression for 14 days than on that of the control mice. Morphine
did not stimulate behavioral activity in the winners before or after
deprivation for 5 days. The aggression level in the winners was higher after
than before deprivation. It has been concluded that, in the winners, the
mu-opioid receptors became tolerant to the effects of morphine and became
sensitized after long aggression deprivation. The development of addiction to
aggression due to repeated victories is discussed in the light of the theory of
addiction (Robinson,Berridge, 2003).

q-bio/0603002,2007-05-23,Mining Mass Spectra: Metric Embeddings and Fast Near Neighbor Search,"  Mining large-scale high-throughput tandem mass spectrometry data sets is a
very important problem in mass spectrometry based protein identification. One
of the fundamental problems in large scale mining of spectra is to design
appropriate metrics and algorithms to avoid all-pair-wise comparisons of
spectra. In this paper, we present a general framework based on vector spaces
to avoid pair-wise comparisons. We first robustly embed spectra in a high
dimensional space in a novel fashion and then apply fast approximate near
neighbor algorithms for tasks such as constructing filters for database search,
indexing and similarity searching. We formally prove that our embedding has low
distortion compared to the cosine similarity, and, along with locality
sensitive hashing (LSH), we design filters for database search that can filter
out more than 989% of peptides (118 times less) while missing at most 0.29% of
the correct sequences. We then show how our framework can be used in similarity
searching, which can then be used to detect tight clusters or replicates. On an
average, for a cluster size of 16 spectra, LSH only misses 1 spectrum and
admits only 1 false spectrum. In addition, our framework in conjunction with
dimension reduction techniques allow us to visualize large datasets in 2D
space. Our framework also has the potential to embed and compare datasets with
post translation modifications (PTM).

q-bio/0603003,2007-05-23,Mathematical Model of HIV superinfection dynamics and R5 to X4 switch,"  During the HIV infection several quasispecies of the virus arise, which are
able to use different coreceptors, in particular the CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors
(R5 and X4 phenotypes, respectively). The switch in coreceptor usage has been
correlated with a faster progression of the disease to the AIDS phase. As
several pharmaceutical companies are starting large phase III trials for R5 and
X4 drugs, models are needed to predict the co-evolutionary and competitive
dynamics of virus strains. We present a model of HIV early infection which
describes the dynamics of R5 quasispecies and a model of HIV late infection
which describes the R5 to X4 switch. We report the following findings: after
superinfection or coinfection, quasispecies dynamics has time scales of several
months and becomes even slower at low number of CD4+ T cells. The curve of CD4+
T cells decreases, during AIDS late stage, and can be described taking into
account the X4 related Tumor Necrosis Factor dynamics. Phylogenetic inference
of chemokine receptors suggests that viral mutational pathway may generate R5
variants able to interact with chemokine receptors different from CXCR4. This
may explain the massive signaling disruptions in the immune system observed
during AIDS late stages and may have relevance for vaccination and therapy.

successfully in many areas. One of these measures, the so-called Universal
Similarity Metric (USM), has been used by Krasnogor and Pelta to compare simple
protein contact maps, showing that it yielded good clustering on four small
datasets. We report an extensive test of this metric using a much larger and
representative protein dataset: the domain dataset used by Sierk and Pearson to
evaluate seven protein structure comparison methods and two protein sequence
comparison methods. One result is that Krasnogor-Pelta method has less domain
discriminant power than any one of the methods considered by Sierk and Pearson
when using these simple contact maps. In another test, we found that the USM
based distance has low agreement with the CATH tree structure for the same
benchmark of Sierk and Pearson. In any case, its agreement is lower than the
one of a standard sequential alignment method, SSEARCH. Finally, we manually
found lots of small subsets of the database that are better clustered using
SSEARCH than USM, to confirm that Krasnogor-Pelta's conclusions were based on
datasets that were too small.

ecological system. These models were converted to adjacency matrices, analyzed
using graph theoretical methods, & augmented into social cognitive maps. Causal
""What-if"" scenarios were run to determine the trajectory of the ecosystem based
on models defined by stakeholders. Villagers had significantly larger numbers
of variables, more complex maps, a broader understanding of all the variables
that affect the Kizilirmak Delta, & mentioned more variables that control the
ecosystem than did NGO and government officials. Villagers adapting to changing
ecological & social conditions actively changed & challenged conditions through
the political process. Villagers were faced with many important forcing
functions that they could not control. Most of the variables defined by
villagers were related to agriculture and animal husbandry. Conservation
policies & ecosystem management must encompass larger environmental issues &
villagers' cognitive maps must be reconciled with that of NGOs & government
officials. Cognitive maps can serve as a basis for discussion when policies &
management options are formulated. A villager-centered cognitive mapping
approach is not only necessary because villagers resist conservation projects,
or because top down projects that do not take local knowledge systems into
account fail, but because it is the ethical and responsible way of doing
ecosystem management.

q-bio/0603029,2009-11-13,"Thermodynamic behavior of a phase transition in a model for sympatric
  speciation","  We investigate the macroscopic effects of the ingredients that drive the
origin of species through sympatric speciation. In our model, sympatric
speciation is obtained as we tune up the strength of competition between
individuals with different phenotypes. As a function of this control parameter,
we can characterize, through the behavior of a macroscopic order parameter, a
phase transition from a non-speciation to a speciation state of the system. The
behavior of the first derivative of the order parameter with respect to the
control parameter is consistent with a phase transition and exhibits a sharp
peak at the transition point. For different resources distribution, the
transition point is shifted, an effect similar to pressure in PVT system. The
inverse of the parameter related to sexual selection strength behaves like an
external field in the system and, as thus, is also a control parameter. The
macroscopic effects of the biological parameters used in our model reveal thus
fingerprints typical of thermodynamic quantities in a phase transition of an
equilibrium physical system.

in bioinformatics. The transposition distance for fully resolved phylogenetic
trees is a recent addition to the extensive collection of available metrics for
comparing phylogenetic trees. In this paper, we generalize the transposition
distance from fully resolved to arbitrary phylogenetic trees, through a
construction that involves an embedding of the set of phylogenetic trees with a
fixed number of labeled leaves into a symmetric group and a generalization of
Reidys-Stadler's involution metric for RNA contact structures. We also present
simple linear-time algorithms for computing it.

  minimum perfect phylogeny haplotyping problems","  The problem Parsimony Haplotyping (PH) asks for the smallest set of
haplotypes which can explain a given set of genotypes, and the problem Minimum
Perfect Phylogeny Haplotyping (MPPH) asks for the smallest such set which also
allows the haplotypes to be embedded in a perfect phylogeny, an evolutionary
tree with biologically-motivated restrictions. For PH, we extend recent work by
further mapping the interface between ``easy'' and ``hard'' instances, within
the framework of (k,l)-bounded instances where the number of 2's per column and
row of the input matrix is restricted. By exploring, in the same way, the
tractability frontier of MPPH we provide the first concrete, positive results
for this problem, and the algorithms underpinning these results offer new
insights about how MPPH might be further tackled in the future. In addition, we
construct for both PH and MPPH polynomial time approximation algorithms, based
on properties of the columns of the input matrix. We conclude with an overview
of intriguing open problems in PH and MPPH.

q-bio/0605029,2007-05-23,"Thriving at high hydrostatic pressure: the example of ammonoids (extinct
  cephalopods)","  Ammonoids are a group of extinct mollusks belonging to the same class of the
living genus Nautilus (Cephalopoda). In both Nautili and ammonoids, the
(usually planospiral) shell is divided into chambers separated by septa that
during the lifetime were filled with gas at atmospheric pressure. The
intersection of septa with the external shell generates a curve called the
suture line, which in living and most fossil Nautili is fairly uncomplicated.
In contrast, suture lines of ancient ammonoid were gently curved and during the
evolution of the group became highly complex, in some cases so extensively
frilled to be considerable as fractal curves. Numerous theories have been put
forward to explain the complexity of suture ammonoid lines. Calculations
presented here lend support to the hypothesis that complex suture lines aided
in counteracting the effect of the external water pressure. Additionally, it is
found that complex suture lines diminished shell shrinkage caused by water
pressure, and thus aided improve buoyancy. Understanding the reason for complex
sutures in ammonoids does not only represent an important issue in
paleobiology, but is also a challenging problem in the resistance of complex
mechanical structures subjected to high pressure.

solution, which is a power function of the state of the process, was found. We
prove that these equations also have generalized self-similar solutions which
describe the temporary transition from one stationary state to another. The

q-bio/0606024,2011-11-10,Bistable equilibrium points of mercury body burden,"  In the last century mercury levels in the global environment have tripled as
a result of increased pollution from industrial, occupational, medicinal and
domestic uses \cite{BaMe03}. Glutathione is known to be the main agent
responsible for the excretion of mercury (we refer to \cite{Thim05},
\cite{ZalBar99} and \cite{Lyn02}). It has also been shown that mercury inhibits
glutathione synthetase (an enzyme acting in the synthesization of Glutathione),
therefore leading to decreased glutathione levels
  (we refer to \cite{Thim05}, \cite{GeGe05}, \cite{GeGe06} and \cite{RDeth04}).
Mercury also interferes with the production of heme in the porphyrin pathway
\cite{WoMaEc93}. Heme is needed for biological energy production and ability to
detox organic toxins via the P450 enzymes \cite{Boy06}. The purpose of this
paper is to show that body's response to mercury exposure is hysteretic, i.e.
when this feedback of mercury on its main detoxifying agents is strong enough
then mercury body burden has two points of equilibrium: one with normal
abilities to detoxify and low levels of mercury and one with inhibited
abilities to detoxify and high levels of mercury. Furthermore, a small increase
of body's mercury burden may not be sufficient to trigger observable neurotoxic
effects but it may be sufficient to act as a switch leading to an accumulation
of mercury in the body through environmental exposure until its toxicity
becomes manifest.

q-bio/0606038,2009-11-13,"Use of the Metropolis algorithm to simulate the dynamics of protein
  chains","  The Metropolis implementation of the Monte Carlo algorithm has been developed
to study the equilibrium thermodynamics of many-body systems. Choosing small
trial moves, the trajectories obtained applying this algorithm agree with those
obtained by Langevin's dynamics. Applying this procedure to a simplified
protein model, it is possible to show that setting a threshold of 1 degree on
the movement of the dihedrals of the protein backbone in a single Monte Carlo
step, the mean quantities associated with the off-equilibrium dynamics (e.g.,
energy, RMSD, etc.) are well reproduced, while the good description of higher
moments requires smaller moves. An important result is that the time duration
of a Monte Carlo step depends linearly on the temperature, something which
should be accounted for when doing simulations at different temperatures.

q-bio/0607005,2009-11-13,Mitochondrial Dna Replacement Versus Nuclear Dna Persistence,"  In this paper we consider two populations whose generations are not
overlapping and whose size is large. The number of males and females in both
populations is constant. Any generation is replaced by a new one and any
individual has two parents for what concerns nuclear DNA and a single one (the
mother) for what concerns mtDNA. Moreover, at any generation some individuals
migrate from the first population to the second.
  In a finite random time $T$, the mtDNA of the second population is completely
replaced by the mtDNA of the first. In the same time, the nuclear DNA is not
completely replaced and a fraction $F$ of the ancient nuclear DNA persists. We
compute both $T$ and $F$. Since this study shows that complete replacement of
mtDNA in a population is compatible with the persistence of a large fraction of
nuclear DNA, it may have some relevance for the Out of Africa/Multiregional
debate in Paleoanthropology.

q-bio/0608005,2007-05-23,"Estimating the Number of Essential Genes in Random Transposon
  Mutagenesis Libraries","  Biologists use random transposon mutagenesis to construct knockout libraries
for bacteria. Random mutagenesis offers cost and efficiency benefits over the
standard site directed mutagenesis, but one can no longer ensure that all the
nonessential genes will appear in the library. In random libraries for haploid
organisms, there is always a class of genes for which knockout clones have not
been made, and the members of this class are either essential or nonessential.
One requires statistical methods to estimate the number of essential genes. Two
groups of researchers, Blades and Broman and Jacobs et al., independently and
simultaneously developed methods to do this. Blades and Broman used a Gibbs
sampler and Jacobs et al. used a parametric bootstrap. We compare the
performance of these two methods and find that they both depend on having an
accurate probabilistic model for transposon insertion or on having a library
with a large number of clones. At this point, we do not have good enough
probabilistic models so we must build libraries that have at least five clones
per open reading frame to accurately estimate the number of essential genes.

  \textit{Quesada gigas}","  Cicadas (Homoptera:Cicadidae) are insects able to produce loudly songs and it
is known that the mechanism to produce sound of tymballing cicadas works as a
Helmholtz resonator. In this work we offer evidence on the participation of the
wings in a high quality resonating process which defines the details of the
acoustic properties of the calling song. The study is carry on \textit{Quesada
gigas} species and it is dividied in three stages: (i) the acoustical
characterization of the abdominal cavity, (ii) the record and calculation of
frequency spectrum of the calling song, and (iii) the measurement of the
vibration modes of the wings. The comparison between all the results
unequivocally show the dramatic influence of the wings in the moment in which
the insect emits its calling song.

q-bio/0609011,2015-06-26,Morphogen Transport in Epithelia,"  We present a general theoretical framework to discuss mechanisms of morphogen
transport and gradient formation in a cell layer. Trafficking events on the
cellular scale lead to transport on larger scales. We discuss in particular the
case of transcytosis where morphogens undergo repeated rounds of
internalization into cells and recycling. Based on a description on the
cellular scale, we derive effective nonlinear transport equations in one and
two dimensions which are valid on larger scales. We derive analytic expressions
for the concentration dependence of the effective diffusion coefficient and the
effective degradation rate. We discuss the effects of a directional bias on
morphogen transport and those of the coupling of the morphogen and receptor
kinetics. Furthermore, we discuss general properties of cellular transport
processes such as the robustness of gradients and relate our results to recent
experiments on the morphogen Decapentaplegic (Dpp) that acts in the fruit fly
Drosophila.

physics, and biology. In the past decade, extensive research into the
properties and behaviors of complex systems has uncovered surprising
commonalities among the topologies of different systems. Attempts to explain
these similarities have led to the ongoing development and refinement of
network models and graph-theoretical analysis techniques with which to
characterize and understand complexity. In this tutorial, we demonstrate
through illustrative examples, how network measures and models have contributed

that we believe are unreasonable when dealing with truly complex systems. We
then introduce Dynamical Structure Functions as an alternative, graphical-model
based representation of LTI systems that contain both dynamical and structural
information of the system. We use Dynamical Structure to prove necessary and
sufficient conditions for estimating structure from data, and demonstrate, for
example, the danger of attempting to use steady-state information to estimate

q-bio/0610044,2007-05-23,Genetic Code as a Harmonic System,"  In a certain way, this paper presents the continuation of the previous one
which discussed the harmonic structure of the genetic code (Rakocevic, 2004).
Several new harmonic structures presented in this paper, through specific unity
and coherence, together with the previously presented (Rakocevic, 2004), show
that it makes sense to understand genetic code as a set of several different
harmonic structures. Thereby, the harmonicity itself represents a specific
unity and coherence of physico-chemical properties of amino acid molecules and
the number of atoms and/or nucleons in the molecules themselves (in the form of
typical balances). A specific Gauss' arithmetical algorithm has the central
position among all these structures and it corresponds to the patterns of the
number of atoms within the side chains of amino acid molecules in the following
sense: G+V = 11; P+I = 21; S+T+L+A+G = 31; D+E+M+C+P = 41; K+R+Q+N+V = 61;
F+Y+W+H+I = 71; (L+M+Q+W) + (A+C+N+H) = 81; (S+D+K+F) + (T+E+R+Y) = 91;
(F+L+M+S+P) = (T+A+Y+H+I) = (Q+N+K+D+V) = (E+C+W+R+G) = 51. Bearing in mind all
these regularities it make sense to talk about genetic code as a harmonic
system. On the other hand, such an order provides new evidence supporting the
hypothesis established in the previous paper (Rakocevic, 2004) that genetic
code has been complete from the very beginning and as such was the condition
for the origin and evolution of life.
"
q-bio/0611004,2007-05-23,The Factors of the Classification of Protein Amino Acids,"  In this work it is shown that three pairs of the factors appear to be the
key, i.e. main factors of a natural classification of protein (canonical) amino
acids within the amino acid (genetic) code. First pair: the factors of the
habit of an amino acid molecule (size and polarity). Second pair: the factors
of the association (type of the amino acid/enzyme reactivity and degree of the
hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of an amino acid molecule). Third pair: the
factors of the dissociation (degree of the acidity-basicity, over acidic group,
COOH and degree of the basicity/acidity over the basic group, NH2). As a result
of the influence and interdependence of all six factors (measured through
correspondent valid parameters) it appears still one natural classification
into polar and non-polar amino acids, where polar amino acids possess negative
and non-polar, the positive values of hydropathy index.

q-bio/0611009,2007-05-23,"Quantum Effects and Genetics Code: Dynamics and Information Transfer in
  DNA Replication","  The possible role of quantum effects in transfer of genetic information is
studied. It's argued that the nucleotides selection during DNA replication is
performed by means of proton tunneling between nucleotide and DNA-polimerase
bound by hydrogen bonds. Such mechanism is sensitive to the structure of
nucleotide hydrogen bonds, consequently only one nucleotide sort is captured by
DNA-polimerase in each event.The algorithm of this multistep selection
mechanism is also analysed from the point of its optimality. It's shown that
it's equivalent to Grover algorithm of data base search.

q-bio/0611020,2007-05-23,"Exploring the assortativity-clustering space of a network's degree
  sequence","  Nowadays there is a multitude of measures designed to capture different
aspects of network structure. To be able to say if the structure of certain
network is expected or not, one needs a reference model (null model). One
frequently used null model is the ensemble of graphs with the same set of
degrees as the original network. In this paper we argue that this ensemble can
be more than just a null model -- it also carries information about the
original network and factors that affect its evolution. By mapping out this
ensemble in the space of some low-level network structure -- in our case those
measured by the assortativity and clustering coefficients -- one can for
example study how close to the valid region of the parameter space the observed
networks are. Such analysis suggests which quantities are actively optimized
during the evolution of the network. We use four very different biological
networks to exemplify our method. Among other things, we find that high
clustering might be a force in the evolution of protein interaction networks.
We also find that all four networks are conspicuously robust to both random
errors and targeted attacks.

q-bio/0611033,2015-06-26,Genetic Code: A New Understanding of Codon - Amino Acid Assignment,"  In this work it is shown that 20 canonical amino acids (AAs) within genetic
code appear to be a whole system with strict AAs positions; more exactly, with
AAs ordinal number in three variants; first variant 00-19, second 00-21 and
third 00-20. The ordinal number follows from the positions of belonging codons,
i.e. their digrams (or doublets). The reading itself is a reading in quaternary
numbering system if four bases possess the values within a specific logical
square: A = 0, C = 1, G = 2, U = 3. By this, all splittings, distinctions and
classifications of AAs appear to be in accordance to atom and nucleon number
balance as well as to the other physico-chemical properties, such as
hydrophobicity and polarity.

q-bio/0611034,2016-08-16,"Compression stress in opposite wood of angiosperms: observations in
  chestnut, mani and poplar","  In order to face environmental constraints, trees are able to re-orient their
axes by controlling the stress level in the newly formed wood layers.
Angiosperms and gymnosperms evolved into two distinct mechanisms: the former
produce a wood with large tension pre-stress on the upper side of the tilted
axis, while the latter produce a wood with large compression pre-stress on the
lower side. In both cases, the difference between this stress level and that of
the opposite side, in light tension, generates the bending of the axis.
However, light values of compression were sometimes measured in the opposite
side of angiosperms. By analysing old data on chestnut and mani and new data on
poplar, this study shows that these values were not measurement artefacts. This
reveals that generating light compression stress in opposite wood contributes
to improve the performance of the re-orientation mechanism.

q-bio/0611041,2008-03-19,Nucleotide Frequencies in Human Genome and Fibonacci Numbers,"  This work presents a mathematical model that establishes an interesting
connection between nucleotide frequencies in human single-stranded DNA and the
famous Fibonacci's numbers. The model relies on two assumptions. First,
Chargaff's second parity rule should be valid, and, second, the nucleotide
frequencies should approach limit values when the number of bases is
sufficiently large. Under these two hypotheses, it is possible to predict the
human nucleotide frequencies with accuracy. It is noteworthy, that the
predicted values are solutions of an optimization problem, which is commonplace
in many nature's phenomena.

q-bio/0611064,2007-11-07,"Frequency and phase synchronization of two coupled neurons with channel
  noise","  We study the frequency and phase synchronization in two coupled identical and
nonidentical neurons with channel noise. The occupation number method is used
to model the neurons in the context of stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley model in which
the strength of of channel noise is represented by ion channel cluster size of
the initiation region of neuron. It is shown that frequency synchronization
only was achieved at arbitrary value of couple strength as long as two neurons'
channel cluster sizes are the same. We also show that the relative phase of
neurons can display profuse dynamic behavior under the combined action of
coupling and channel noise. Both qualitative and quantitative descriptions are
applied to describe the transitions between those behaviors. Relevance of our
findings to controlling neural synchronization experimentally is discussed.

interactions between species in ecological systems. For interspecific
competition, the exclusion conjecture (Gause) is put in a symbolic way and used
as a basic operational tool to consider more complex cases like two species
with two superposed resources (niche differentiation) and apparent competitors.
Competition between tortoises and invaders in Galapagos islands is considered
as a specific example. Our theory gives us an operative language to consider

q-bio/0611068,2007-05-23,Gene expression from polynomial dynamics in the 2-adic information space,"  We perform geometrization of genetics by representing genetic information by
points of the 4-adic {\it information space.} By well known theorem of number
theory this space can also be represented as the 2-adic space. The process of
DNA-reproduction is described by the action of a 4-adic (or equivalently
2-adic) dynamical system. As we know, the genes contain information for
production of proteins. The genetic code is a degenerate map of codons to
proteins. We model this map as functioning of a polynomial dynamical system.
The purely mathematical problem under consideration is to find a dynamical
system reproducing the degenerate structure of the genetic code. We present one
of possible solutions of this problem.

about our observation is not that there is a connection between number theory
and the genetic code, but the simplicity of the rule. We hope that the
observation and the naive model presented in this paper will serve for ideas to
other models of the degeneracy of the genetic code. Maybe, the ideas of this
article can also be used in the area of artificial life to syntesize artificial
genetic codes.

q-bio/0612030,2007-05-23,"Cognitive Maps of Complex Systems Show Hierarchical Structure and
  Scale-Free Properties","  Many networks in natural and human-made systems exhibit scale-free properties
and are small worlds. Now we show that people's understanding of complex
systems in their cognitive maps also follow a scale-free topology (P_k =
k^-lambda, lambda [1.24,3.03]; r^2 <= 0.95). People focus on a few attributes,
as indicated by a fat tail in the probability distribution of total degree.
These few attributes are related with many other variables in the system. Many
more attributes have very few connections. The scale-free properties in the
cognitive maps of people arise despite the fact that their average distances
are not different (Wilcoxon sign-rank test, W=78, p=0.75) than random networks
of the same size and connection density. The scale-free property manifests
itself in the higher hierarchical structure compared to random networks
(Wilcoxon sign-rank test, W=12, p=0.03). People use relatively short
explanations to describe systems. These findings may help us to better
understand people's perceptions, especially when it comes to decision-making,
conflict resolution, politics and management.

using an all-atom representation of the molecules and an implicit solvation
model to approximate the interaction with the surrounding solvent. The results
confirm earlier observations that the helix-coil transition in proteins can be
described by a set of critical exponents. The high statistics of the
simulations allows the authors to determine the exponents values with increased
precision and support universality of the helix-coil transition in homopolymers

q-bio/0701031,2007-05-23,Lotka-Volterra population model of genetic evolution,"  A deterministic model of an age-structured population with genetics analogous
to the discrete time Penna model of genetic evolution is constructed on the
basis of the Lotka-Volterra scheme. It is shown that if, as in the Penna model,
genetic information is represented by the fraction of defective genes in the
population, the population numbers for each specific individual's age are
represented by exactly the same functions of age in both models. This gives us
a new possibility to consider multi-species evolution without using detailed
microscopic Penna model.
  We discuss a particular case of the predator-prey system representing an
ecosystem consisting of a limited amount of energy resources consumed by the
age-structured species living in this ecosystem. Then, the increase in number
of the individuals in the population under consideration depends on the
available energy resources, the shape of the distribution function of defective
genes in the population and the fertility age. We show that these parameters
determine the trend toward equilibrium of the whole ecosystem.
"
q-bio/0701033,2007-05-23,Noise Correlation Induced Synchronization in a Mutualism Ecosystem,"  Understanding the cause of the synchronization of population evolution is an
important issue for ecological improvement. Here we present a
Lotka-Volterra-type model driven by two correlated environmental noises and
show, via theoretical analysis and direct simulation, that noise correlation
can induce a synchronization of the mutualists. The time series of mutual
species exhibit a chaotic-like fluctuation, which is independent to the noise
correlation, however, the chaotic fluctuation of mutual species ratio decreases
with the noise correlation. A quantitative parameter defined for characterizing
chaotic fluctuation provides a good approach to measure when the complete
synchronization happens.

q-bio/0701038,2007-05-23,"Modeling the Worldwide Spread of Pandemic Influenza: Baseline Case and
  Containment Interventions","  We present a study of the worldwide spread of a pandemic influenza and its
possible containment at a global level taking into account all available
information on air travel. We studied a metapopulation stochastic epidemic
model on a global scale that considers airline travel flow data among urban
areas. We provided a temporal and spatial evolution of the pandemic with a
sensitivity analysis of different levels of infectiousness of the virus and
initial outbreak conditions (both geographical and seasonal). For each
spreading scenario we provided the timeline and the geographical impact of the
pandemic in 3,100 urban areas, located in 220 different countries. We compared
the baseline cases with different containment strategies, including travel
restrictions and the therapeutic use of antiviral (AV) drugs. We show that the
inclusion of air transportation is crucial in the assessment of the occurrence
probability of global outbreaks. The large-scale therapeutic usage of AV drugs
in all hit countries would be able to mitigate a pandemic effect with a
reproductive rate as high as 1.9 during the first year; with AV supply use
sufficient to treat approximately 2% to 6% of the population, in conjunction
with efficient case detection and timely drug distribution. For highly
contagious viruses (i.e., a reproductive rate as high as 2.3), even the
unrealistic use of supplies corresponding to the treatment of approximately 20%
of the population leaves 30%-50% of the population infected. In the case of
limited AV supplies and pandemics with a reproductive rate as high as 1.9, we
demonstrate that the more cooperative the strategy, the more effective are the
containment results in all regions of the world, including those countries that
made part of their resources available for global use.

of the variation and selection processes. As a result, the population thinking
had always been an integral part of the Darwinian approach. I propose an
alternative scheme of biological adaptation. It is based on appreciation of
limits of what we can observe considering an individual biological object. This
leads to a possibility for the adaptation process to occur on the level of a

concerning the neural cell activity in the brain area known as hippocampus
suggests a particular mechanism of spatial information and memory processing.
Below it is argued that the spatial information available through the analysis
of the hippocampal cell activity is predominantly of topological nature. It is
pointed out that a direct topological analysis can produce a topological
invariant based classification of the cell activity patterns and a complete
topological description of animal's current environment. It also provides a
full first order logical system for local topological reasoning about spatial
structure and animal's navigational strategies.

q-bio/0702055,2007-05-23,"Positive Feedback, Stochasticity and Genetic Competence","  A single gene, regulating its own expression via a positive feedback loop,
constitutes a common motif in gene regulatory networks and signalling cascades.
Recent experiments on the development of competence in the bacterial population
\emph{B. subtilis} show that the autoregulatory genetic module by itself can
give rise to two types of cellular states. The states correspond to the low and
high expression states of the master regulator ComK. The high expression state
is attained when the ComK protein level exceeds a threshold value leading to a
full activation of the autostimulatory loop. Stochasticity in gene expression
drives the transitions between the two stable states. In this paper, we explain
the appearance of bimodal protein distributions in \emph{B. subtilis} cell
population in the framework of three possible scenarios. In two of the cases,
bistability provides the basis for binary gene expression. In the third case,
the system is monostable in a deterministic description and stochasticity in
gene expression is solely responsible for the appearance of the two expression
states.

embodies our understanding of this natural process and the way it immediately
communicates this understanding. However, advancements in molecular biology
over the past several decades must lead to a realization that our basic
understanding of genetic translation is fundamentally flawed and incomplete,
and, therefore, our icon is inadequate. A better understanding of symmetry and
an appreciation for the essential role it has played in codon formation will
improve our understanding of nature's coding processes. Incorporation of that

determined by Gauss arithmetical algorithm; by Table of Minimal Adding, as in
(Rakocevic, 2011a: Table 4; 2011b: Table 4); all structures in relation to
Binary-code tree (Rakocevic, 1998). The determination itself is realized
through atom and nucleon number balancing and nuancing of molekular polarity.
In the first supplement the word is about some additional harmonic structures
in relation to a previous our paper (Rakocevic, 2004); in the second one about
the relation that structures with the polarity of protein amino acids. In the

doubling of the system degrees of freedom. We show that the doubled modes
account for the quantum noise in the fluctuating random force in the
system-environment coupling. Remarkably, such a noise manifests itself through
the coherent structure of the system ground state. The entanglement of the
system modes with the doubled modes is shown to be permanent in the infinite
volume limit. In such a limit the trajectories in the memory space are
classical chaotic trajectories.

quant-ph/0412170,2007-05-23,"Criteria for quantum coherent transfer of excitons between chromophores
  in a polar solvent","  We show that the quantum decoherence of Forster resonant energy transfer
between two optically active molecules can be described by a spin-boson model.
This allows us to give quantitative criteria, in terms of experimentally
measurable system parameters, that are necessary for coherent Bloch
oscillations of excitons between the chromophores. Experimental tests of our
results should be possible with Flourescent Resonant Energy Transfer (FRET)
spectroscopy. Although we focus on the case of protein-pigment complexes our
results are also relevant to quantum dots and organic molecules in a dielectric
medium.

quant-ph/0609216,2009-11-13,A Quantum Approach to Classical Statistical Mechanics,"  We present a new approach to study the thermodynamic properties of
$d$-dimensional classical systems by reducing the problem to the computation of
ground state properties of a $d$-dimensional quantum model. This
classical-to-quantum mapping allows us to deal with standard optimization
methods, such as simulated and quantum annealing, on an equal basis.
Consequently, we extend the quantum annealing method to simulate classical
systems at finite temperatures. Using the adiabatic theorem of quantum
mechanics, we derive the rates to assure convergence to the optimal
thermodynamic state. For simulated and quantum annealing, we obtain the
asymptotic rates of $T(t) \approx (p N) /(k_B \log t)$ and $\gamma(t) \approx
(Nt)^{-\bar{c}/N}$, for the temperature and magnetic field, respectively. Other
annealing strategies, as well as their potential speed-up, are also discussed.

quant-ph/9912070,2007-05-23,Quantum dissipation and neural net dynamics,"  Inspired by the dissipative quantum model of brain, we model the states of
neural nets in terms of collective modes by the help of the formalism of
Quantum Field Theory. We exhibit an explicit neural net model which allows to
memorize a sequence of several informations without reciprocal destructive
interference, namely we solve the overprinting problem in such a way last
registered information does not destroy the ones previously registered.
Moreover, the net is able to recall not only the last registered information in
the sequence, but also anyone of those previously registered.
